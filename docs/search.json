Some opportunities and challenges include:\n\nStructural economic transitions to a net zero economy\nBuilding resilience to natural disasters\nGeographic spread and thin markets for some services\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework provides a guide for investing in regions to make the most of these opportunities and address challenges in a collaborative way, taking account of local voices.\n\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nThe Australian Government’s Regional Investment Framework provides an integrated and coordinated framework for regional development regardless of a region’s economic circumstances with the following guiding principles:\n\nRealising that the Government’s ambition of ‘no one held back and no one left behind’ requires specific regional investment across portfolios.\nAustralia’s regions and their economies are diverse, with each having unique strengths and challenges.\nDelivering on the potential of regional Australia requires building on each regions’ unique strengths, including helping regions undergoing significant economic change to transition or adapt to specific structural challenges.\nPlace-based decision making that draws on the experience of local government alongside regional bodies must guide investment in our regions.\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nResponsibility for the levers that influence regional development (i.e. education, infrastructure, employment services, services, industry and trade) sit across national, state/territory governments and local governments.\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework provides a guide for the Australian Government to work more closely with state, territory and local governments to ensure policy development and delivery is joined up and local voices are taken into consideration.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe 2023-24 Regional Ministerial Budget Statement outlines the Australian Government’s latest investment in regional development across 15 portfolios – specifically 129 new initiatives that improve regional livability, health services and people’s wellbeing, and underpin prosperous economic futures and the transition to net zero. This builds on over 220 packages and initiatives to strengthen regional communities and economies announced in the 2022-23 October Budget.\nMajor recent initiatives include: $1.0 billion for the Growing Regions and regional Precincts and Partnerships programs to fund community infrastructure projects and larger-scale infrastructure investment; $1.9 billion for the Powering the Regions Fund to support regions in their transition to net zero, including $1.4 billion to support industrial decarbonisation; the development of new clean energy industries, and workforce development; and $15.0 billion for the National Reconstruction Fund to diversify industrial capability across seven priority areas, many of which have a significant presence in regional Australia.\nState and Territory governments also provide significant contributions to regional Australia which fund infrastructure and essential services such as health and education.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nThe new Regional Investment Framework enables the Australian Government to take a dedicated focus on investments and initiatives across the spectrum of portfolio areas that support: people, the places they live in, the services they rely on, and the regional industries and local economies that are vital to the nation’s prosperity.\nThe Framework’s guiding principles recognise and respond to the diversity of regions, welcome and incorporate local voices and knowledge, and leverage collective effort across governments, communities and the private sector through genuine partnerships.\nThe Framework embeds regular and frequent engagement across the broad range of Commonwealth portfolios and with other levels of government. This will ensure joined-up approaches that leverage investments, reduce duplication, and deliver cumulative benefits for our regions and their people.\nThis approach is supported by international best practice and the OECD which cites the need for good governance, effective coordination and place-based investment that considers a region’s size, population, etc. to address inequalities, megatrends and future shocks.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThe Australian Government is developing a new National Urban Policy. The National Urban Policy will explore opportunities and challenges facing urban communities and will consider how coordinated action by governments can support more productive, equitable and resilient cities and suburbs.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nRefer to ‘national regional development policy framework’\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nIn line with the Regional Investment Framework, the Australian Government supports regional development through a number of major grant programs, including:\n\nThe regional Precincts and Partnerships Program, which will provide a strategic, nationally consistent mechanism for funding and coordinating projects that transform a place, to benefit communities in regional Australia and help regions move towards net-zero emissions, a decarbonised economy and sustained regional growth.\nThe Growing Regions Program, which provides grants to local government entities and not-for-profit organisations for capital works projects that deliver community and economic infrastructure across regional and rural Australia.\n\nState/territory governments also each have their own specific regional development policy, grant programs and economic development plans.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\nThe Australian Government uses a number of tools to coordinate policy at a national level including:\n\nInterdepartmental Committees, which are a common governance mechanism within the Australian Government to facilitate policy coordination across agencies.\nRegional Australia Impact Statements, which provide a mechanism for Australian Government Cabinet Ministers to receive a summary of the potential impacts that a policy proposal will have on regional Australia and to ensure that their implications and possible mitigation measures are considered in whole-of-Government decision-making.\n\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nExamples of multi-level governance mechanisms used by national and subnational governments include the following:\n\nNational Cabinet is chaired by the Prime Minister with state and territory First Ministers as members, and is used to collaboratively address a wide range of issues of national significance. The Commonwealth and state and territory governments individually have flexibility to determine the best way to achieve any agreed outcomes made by National Cabinet in their jurisdiction.\nRegional Precincts and Partnerships are currently being developed to enable collaboration between all levels of government to achieve a community’s vision.\nThe Regional Deputy Senior Officials Meeting is a mechanism for Australian, state/territory, and local government officials to share information and collaborate to leverage better outcomes for regions.\n\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nA range of policy coordination tools at the regional level exist including:\n\nRegional Development Australia Committees, which are a network of local leaders who work across government, business and community groups to improve their local region. This is achieved by supporting economic and workforce development, local procurement, strategic regional planning and informing government programs and infrastructure investments.\nMany regions also have peak regional advocacy bodies such as ‘One Gippsland’ in the state of Victoria.\n\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nThe Australian Government monitors the effectiveness of its programs and policies through tools including:\n\nMany regional grant programs have evaluation plans to review their effectiveness and determine key lessons for ongoing policy design.\nA centralised evaluation unit is being established in the Australian Government Treasury. This unit will partner with agencies across government to evaluate key programs and support the enablers of high-quality evaluation.\n\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework released in May 2023 sets the future direction for Australia’s regional policy and focuses on investment in the four following key areas:\n\nPeople – listening to local voices and partnering with communities\nPlaces – supporting adaptive, accessible, sustainable and liveable regions\nServices – enhancing connectivity, accessibility and equity of services\nIndustries and Local Economies – investment to help activate economic and industry growth.\n\nIn addition, the Framework embeds ongoing and regular collaboration and engagement across Australian Government agencies and with state and territory governments. This will help ensure regional development policies are joined up and leverage investment to ensure the best outcomes for regional Australia."

In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

As a result, around 90% of the population is spread over 30% of the land. Also, as Eurostat data shows, the population density in Spain in 2019 stood at 93.8 people per square kilometer, below the EU average of 109 inhab./km2 . Moreover, based on municipal organization data, municipalities with 5,000 or fewer inhabitants represent (as of January 1, 2021) 83.9% of the total, although they host about 5.69 million people, or 12% of the total Spanish population. At the same time, a significant number of municipalities with between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants also present worrying patterns of depopulation and ageing population. Specifically, on January 1, 2021, from the 899 municipalities between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants, 36% have lost population in the period 2016-2021 and in more than a third of these locations (35%), at least 20% of the population is over 65 years old.\nSpain has the longest life expectancy in the EU, with 20% of the population aged 65+ and 1/3 of this share is 80+.\nIn rural areas and intermediate cities, the proportion of older people is higher (38-48% for rural areas, and 31% of the total population for intermediate regions). Also, the effect of tourism increases the disparities, due to the floating population effect and large seasonal population increases, mostly concentrated in highly densely populated coastal areas where land use pressure and cost is intensified.\nIn addition, depopulated areas suffer from higher masculization ratios, young brain drain loss, salary and digital gaps, smaller sized companies which, among other factors, typically result in lower productivity and innovation rates compared to urban areas.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nGiving the above described situation, the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic created in October 2020 the General Secretariat of Demographic Challenge, with the following duties (approved by Royal Decree 500/2020):\n\nThe preparation, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial administrations, and the proposal and promotion, within the scope of the General State Administration, of the general objectives, strategies and plans and priority actions regarding the demographic challenge.\nThe coordination of other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations in matters of the demographic challenge, as well as the promotion of public-private collaboration for the achievement of the objectives related to the demographic challenge.\nThe functions that the Law for the Sustainable Development of the Rural Environment of 2007 attributes to the General State Administration.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competencies of other ministerial departments, of equal opportunities and non-discrimination based on residence and age, as well as the promotion and safeguarding, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations, of the appropriate provision of basic services to the entire population, under conditions of equity, with special attention to children, youth and the elderly.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competences of other ministerial departments, of the role of women in rural areas, as well as the social and labor inclusion of immigrants in areas at demographic risk.\nThe coordination of policies aimed at promoting the reconciliation of family and professional life, co-responsibility, child rearing and the development of family projects, especially in the areas most affected by demographic risks.\nThe coordination of public policies, within the scope of the General State Administration, aimed at promoting awareness, knowledge and training, from childhood and youth, and throughout life, which enhance the value of the territory, especially in rural areas, and promote the knowledge and revitalization of existing opportunities in areas affected by depopulation.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competencies of other ministerial departments, of investment, employment opportunities, diversification and economic development, with the aim of strengthening the socioeconomic fabric in areas affected by depopulation.\nThe promotion and encouragement, in collaboration with the other ministerial departments and the territorial public administrations, of the adequate dimensioning of the infrastructures and equipment necessary to face the demographic challenge.\nThe promotion and encouragement, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations, of policies aimed at addressing the progressive aging and the effects of the floating population.\nParticipation in representation of the Ministry in international organizations and monitoring of international agreements on the demographic challenge.\n\nParticipation in representation of the General State Administration in Councils of the European Union in matters of demographic challenge and other international organizations.\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 174.\n2030 National Strategy for Demographic Challenge: It establishes the objectives and strategic lines of action to advance in territorial cohesion and fight against depopulation.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe General Secretariat was created on January 29, 20203 as a result of the integration of the competences on demography and its problems in the Ministry of Ecological Transition.\nFor the exercise of its functions, the General Secretariat was endowed with a management body, the General Directorate for Policies against Depopulation, and a Technical Office to assist the Secretary General. In 2022, the body's budget practically tripled due to the creation, among other initiatives, of the State Territorial Cohesion Fund, initially endowed with 29 million euros, among other tasks.

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.031 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.053 higher in the same period, indicating bottom convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level. Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.178. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.03 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.095. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.016 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.113 in 2020 and increased by 0.028 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland). Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nIn Spain, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity remained stable between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity grew roughly by 11% in both groups of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.  Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Spain, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the industrial sector reduced the labour productivity gap between regions. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions, approximately by the same amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe National strategy for sustainable regional development throughout Sweden 2021–2030 is the framework for the regional development policy until 2030. The national strategy was submitted by the previous government in March 2021 in the form of a letter (skr. 2020/21:133) to the Parliament (Riksdag). The Riksdag approved it in June 2022 in accordance with the proposal of the Committee on Industry and Trade. The strategy highlights three basic prerequisites for effective implementation:  capacity for regional and local development work regional consideration and cooperation between state agencies, regions and other actors, as well as learning through analysis, follow-up, evaluation and research.  In the strategy, there are four strategic areas that will form the basis for the implementation of the regional development policy 2021–2030. The strategy with its strategic areas and priorities is indicative for the regional development strategies of the regions.  equal opportunities for housing, work and welfare throughout the country competence supply and competence development throughout the country innovation and renewal as well as entrepreneurship and business development throughout the country accessibility throughout the country through digital communication and the transport system.  The commission approved the Swedish partnership agreement in May 2022. The Partnership Agreement sets out the strategic orientation for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Just Transition Fund (JTF), the European Social Fund+ (ESF+) and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF). All ERDF-programs, including all Interreg programs in which Sweden participates, were approved in 2022. The national program and the eight regional programmes comprise a total of approximately EUR 2,1 billion, including Swedish co-financing during the program period. In addition, the national envelope from ERDF regarding cross-border and transnational cooperation is EUR 358 million. The implementation of the ERDF-programs means that important investments in entrepreneurship, innovations, energy efficiency, climate change, circular economy and cross-regional cooperation can be made around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

This economic development program promotes projects, initiatives, and programs that improve the economic framework conditions for entrepreneurial activities and sustainably enhance innovation capacity, value creation, and, thus, competitiveness. In this way, the Swiss regional policy contributes to creating and preserving jobs in the regions concerned.

On the fiscal equalization mechanisms, we possess the National fiscal equalization. Federalism is one of Switzerland’s fundamental principles. The 26 cantons and 2,148 communes have extensive powers. Fiscal equalization is thus also important for the unity of the country. It is based on the principle of solidarity: the economically strong cantons and the Confederation help out the economically weaker cantons.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nBroader Sense: Swiss Umbrella strategy on “coherent spatial development” which aims at aligning spatial effects of sectoral and regional policies in urban and rural areas and their interlinkages\nNarrow Sense: The New Regional Policy (NRP) is the Swiss national regional development policy framework based on the Federal Law on Regional Policy.\nRegional innovation system\nInterreg programs A / B & C\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThrough the agglomeration policy (AggloPol), the federal government supports Switzerland's agglomerations with their cities and municipalities in further sustainable development. Several specific measures are available for the implementation of the policy. These complement the measures of various sectoral policies, such as transport or social policies. As a cross-cutting policy, AggloPol also provides a framework of objectives and actions for implementing and coordinating the various sectoral policies in urban areas.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nPERM - Policy for rural areas and mountain regions\nThe New Regional Policy (NRP)\nThe agricultural policy\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\n26 Cantonal development policies are active and work with the government to enhance each region and answer their particular needs.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination at national level\nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs, Regional and spatial planning policy\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nConference of Cantonal Services\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\n\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nRegional systems of evaluation and monitoring\nRegular extern assessments\nGovernmental Indicators (outcomes / output) from defined objectives\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nBroader Sense: Strategy on coherent spatial development undergoes an actualization.\nNarrow Sense: With the program 2024-2017, the future orientations of the NRP will enter its third eight-year period (2024-2031). The former priority themes of \"Industry / Innovation\" and \"Tourism\" will be maintained. Smaller infrastructures can now be supported under certain conditions with non-repayable contributions. In addition to \"local economy,\" which complements the export-oriented approach of NPR, sustainability, and digitalization will be particularly important cross-cutting themes."

The NPR supports innovation in SMEs at the business-to-business level in rural areas, mountain regions, and border regions. This support is provided mainly through the six \"Regional innovation systems\" (RIS), which promote competitiveness and innovation capacity, help for access to technological innovation and innovation that goes beyond technological innovation, offer support and coordinated services in the areas of information, advice, networking, infrastructure, and financing. Tourism: Tourism is vital to the regional economy, especially in mountain regions. The NPR encourages the development of new tourism offers and innovative products in this field. It also promotes collaborative projects between destinations and participates in financing tourism infrastructures that increase value creation in the region. Digitalisation: Digitalisation affects all areas of the economy. NPR supports and promotes digitalisation projects within its scope of impact. It also invests in awareness-raising and networking measures to prevent regions from being left behind in the digital age.

The new NSRD (2024-2028) is in the preparation phase and its vision is “A globally competitive and fully developed Türkiye by using its local dynamics and prosperous regions.” The elaboration process of the new NSRD involves input, consultation, and negotiation with various stakeholders, including the public and private sectors, NGOs, universities, development agencies (DAs), and local entities. NSRD is intended to serve as the primary coordination document for regional development policies and to be the second comprehensive plan focused on addressing regional development disparities and enhancing regional competitiveness in Türkiye. Within the scope of the new NSRD, eight themes have been determined;  Urban Development, Rural Development, Social Policies, Industry-Logistics-Transportation, Green Growth, R&D, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Digitalization and Tourism  Strategies have been developed for the 2024-2028 period under these themes. After undergoing technical evaluations, the strategy will be approved by the Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Regional inequality trends\nThe United Kingdom experienced an increase in the Theil index of GDP per capita over 2000-2020. Inequality reached its maximum in 2015. The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.061 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio did not change in the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level. Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.078. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.035 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.111. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.069 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.16 in 2020 and decreased by 0.031 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland). Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nIn United Kingdom, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2004 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 10%, 3 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.  Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In United Kingdom, between 2004 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions, approximately by the same amount. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector reduced the labour productivity gap between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\n\nThere is no explicit regional development policy framework since the Regional Development Agencies in England were closed in 2010. However, since 2011 the UK Government has shifted its focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships, of which there are currently 38, to bring together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England and deliver some government programmes including the Local Growth Fund, Getting Building Fund and programmes linked to skills development. The three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have responsibility for urban, regional and spatial planning policies in their areas, but the UK Government has established offices in all three territories to help deliver UK wide levelling-up programmes such as the Levelling Up Fund, UK Shared Prosperity Fund and Communities Opportunities Fund, among other initiatives. With the launch of the Levelling Up White Paper in 2022, there has been an enhanced programme of spreading opportunity to all parts of the country and the three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Since 2011, in England the government has shifted focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships and has pursued a policy of devolving more power and resources to local and combined authorities such as Mayoral Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities. Devolution is at the heart of the UK Government’s plans to increase economic growth and level up the whole country. The Government announced the biggest ever transfer of powers away from Westminster in the Levelling Up White Paper. It is committed to further extending devolution across England and seeing more empowered and accountable local leaders who can drive growth, innovate, and respond to the specific challenges and needs of their areas. Six new devolution deals were announced in 2022 to drive forward improved outcomes for over 7.2million people that live in those areas by directly electing a mayor/leader to represent them in the future. The six deals agreed in 2022 will bring devolution to over 52% of the English population, up from 41% in 2021. The new deals agreed in 2022 will see over £4bn invested in local areas over a period of 30 years. Once mayors are elected, these deals will give their mayors and leaders greater local control over things like transport, infrastructure and skills. Discussions with places to identify potential candidates for the next set of new devolution deals is well underway in 2023. For over 11 years 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have brought together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England. They have also been responsible for the delivery of a number of funding streams that have provided support to businesses and invested in local infrastructure. Since publication of the Levelling Up White Paper, strong progress has been made on extending devolution across England. To this end, the UK Government intends for the functions of LEPs to be delivered by democratically elected local leaders where appropriate in the future, and where they are not already delivered by Combined Authorities. It is minded to withdraw core funding for LEPs from April 2024. To minimise any disruption for LEPs, the areas they support, and delivery of Government programmes the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and the Department for Business and Trade are consulting LEPs and other key stakeholders on this proposal. An eight-week information gathering exercise was launched on 17 March, before confirming a decision (consultation closes on 19 May). The Government will publish an updated policy position to confirm next steps by summer 2023. The Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are largely responsible for regional economic development and spatial planning in their territories. The Welsh Government published “Future Wales - the National Plan 2040” in February 2021. This sets out the national development plan and spatial strategy for Wales. Scotland published a 4th update to its National Planning Framework in February 2023. This provides a national spatial strategy for Scotland setting out its spatial principles, regional priorities and national planning policy. Northern Ireland has a Regional Development Strategy 2035. This puts in place spatial planning, transport and housing priorities to support economic growth and regional prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019).

In United States, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector remained approximately stable across all regions. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions, approximately by the same amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe United States has always had a focus on policies that address place-based needs. Most recently, there has been a greater emphasis on equity, especially for historically underserved geographies and populations. This includes rural areas, tribal lands, and minorities such as Black, Latino, and American Indian populations. The U.S. is taking a whole of government approach to address regional inequalities. In terms of new initiatives, a key example is EDA’s recent $3 billion American Rescue Plan program to meet the urgent needs of American communities for economic recovery and resiliency in face of the pandemic. In 2022, EDA made 780 grants awarded through six innovative programs to support transformational American Rescue Plan projects. EDA’s American Rescue Plan grant programs include:  Build Back Better Regional Challenge: $1 billion awarded to 21 regional coalitions (5-8 component awards per coalition), each of which received between $25 million and $65 million to transform their regional economy by growing an industry sector. EDA also gave awards to 60 phase 1 finalists to support the development of their ambitious projects. Good Jobs Challenge: $500 million awarded to 32 industry-led workforce training partnerships to invest in innovative approaches to workforce development that will secure job opportunities for more than 50,000 Americans. Economic Adjustment Assistance program: $500 million awarded to 256 diverse projects —including but not limited to enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities and planning grants — to address the economic development needs of communities today while preparing them for the future by in investing in enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities, and planning grants. Indigenous Communities program: $100 million awarded to 51 grantees to support economic development projects in Indigenous communities for similar types of projects as described under Economic Adjustment Assistance. Across all six American Rescue Plan programs, inclusive of the Indigenous Communities program, EDA awarded a total of 127 grants totalling $448 million. Travel, Tourism & Outdoor Recreation program: $750 million awarded to 185 grantees to help support regions hard hit by declines to these industries through projects to build new tourist attractions (museums, event venues, hiking trails, campgrounds, etc.), develop tourism-related economic plans, and support workforce training in the tourism sector. Statewide Planning, Research & Networks: $1 million planning grants to each of the 59 U.S. states and territories and $31 million to 14 research and networks (also known as Communities of Practice) grantees. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

These strategies commit Ireland to a ten-year planning and investment programme which ensures balanced regional growth across Ireland, with a particular focus on the continued development of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford as accessible centres of scale, in addition to supporting Dublin as the Capital City.\nFrom a funding perspective, significant resources are being provided to enhance the urban environment of our cities, towns and villages through the Urban and Regional Development Fund (URDF) under Project Ireland 2040. The URDF fund has an overall provision of €2 billion to support projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland’s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and NDP and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) adopted by each of the three Regional Assemblies.\nRecent URDF Funding allocations, by Region, are outlined as follows:\n\n\n\nRegional Authority Area\nNumber of Projects\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nEastern and Midlands Region**\n56\nc. €638 million\n\n\nSouthern Region*\n46\nc. €787 million\n\n\nNorthern and Western Region*\n30\nc. €212 million\n\n\n\n*Figures from August 2022 ; **Figures from June 2023\nA full list of all NDP funded programs, by region, and including funding amounts, is available on the NDP Tracker:\nhttps://www.gov.ie/en/collection/f828b-myprojectireland-interactive-map/\nRegional assemblies also manage certain EU funding programmes like the European Regional Development Fund. Funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is also targeted at balanced regional development, with percentage dividends distributed in line with regional need i.e. ‘more developed’ regions, the Southern and the Eastern & Midlands regions will receive 40% in EU financing, while as a ‘transition’ region the North-Western region will receive 55% in EU financing.\nIn addition to the above, investment for the development of rural Ireland is available through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. (Further details of funding provision is contained within the ‘Rural policy framework’ section of this report).\n\n\nKey regional development challenges\nOn a regional and national level, it is well documented that Ireland has faced particular challenges in terms of housing delivery over recent years. Several Government initiatives are addressing this issue and pursuant to the aims and objectives included within the overarching Government strategy ‘Housing for All’, there are plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 units per year over the next decade. This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4bn per annum, through an overall combination of €12bn in direct Exchequer funding, €3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.\nPublication of new dwelling completion figures, released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), on a national basis, shows the following trends on housing delivery up to Q4 2022.\nNew dwelling completions for 2022 totalled 29,822, an increase of 45.1% on 2021, when 20,553 dwellings were completed.\nIn 2022, 84.1% of all new dwelling completions were in urban areas and the remainder in rural areas. At the beginning of the series in 2011, 38% were in urban and 62% in rural areas.\nFurthermore, the Irish Government is continually responding to a changing policy context as it relates to national, regional and local planning policy, with specific consideration to be given to climate transition requirements – addressing sectoral emission targets and the Climate Action Plan 2023; changing and diverse demographics, particularly during periods of uncertainty (war in Ukraine) and the impacts of digitalisation on work, retail, commuting and regional development.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nAs previously outlined, Regional Policy Objectives for each of the three individual regions are contained within the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES’s) and align to National policy objectives contained with the NPF and NDP; and are implemented through the Project Ireland 2040 (PI2040) Delivery Board with the support of the Regional Assemblies. Metropolitan area strategic plans (MASP’s) for each of the five city-regions in Ireland, including Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are also contained within the relevant RSES.\nKey ‘Regional Policy Objectives’ relate to the 10 identified ‘National Strategic Outcomes’ of the NPF, which include a focus upon:\n\nCompact Growth\nEnhanced Regional Accessibility\nStrengthening Rural Economies and Communities\nSustainable Mobility\nA Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills\nHigh-Quality International Connectivity\nEnhanced Amenity and Heritage\nTransition to Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society\nSustainable Management of Water, Waste and other Environmental Resources\nAccess to Quality Childcare, Education and Health Services\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nLegal Framework\nPlanning legislation (Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended) recognises the importance of the RSES in establishing a regional roadmap for the strategic delivery of sustainable development of urban and rural areas to secure balanced regional development and co-ordination of plans at regional and local level. The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, (the Act), provides the legislative framework for the enactment of the RSES’s.\nPursuant to Section 21 of the Act, a Regional Assembly may make a Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy:\n\nafter consultation with the planning authorities within its region, or\nin the case of the regional assemblies in respect of the GDA, after consultation with the planning authorities within their regions and the NTA, or\nshall make a regional spatial and economic strategy, at the direction of the Minister.\n\nLegislative requirements regarding consultation, procedure, monitoring and review of the RSES’s are contained within Section 22 to 27D of the Act, as well as requirements for local planning policy to be consistent with the objectives contained within each individual RSES.\nInstitutional Framework\n\nMember’s Associations: The members of the Regional Assemblies are nominated from the elected members of the local authorities in the region. The national association with the role of protecting and promoting the interests of the regional assembly members is the Association of Irish Regions (AIR). For locally elected members of local government in Ireland the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG) also serves this function. The AILG explicitly represent the elected members as there is a separate association for the chief executives – the County and City Management Association (CCMA).\nState Bodies: A number of State bodies, under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage support the objectives of the RSES, including monitoring and review, an outline of which is set out below.\nLand Development Agency (LDA): The Land Development Agency (LDA) was established on an interim basis in September 2018 by way of an Establishment Order made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971. The Land Development Agency Act 2021 was enacted in July 2021 and following commencement of relevant provisions, the Land Development Agency Designated Activity Company was incorporated in December 2021. Following the dissolution of the interim entity, the LDA has been established as a commercial state body. The agency assists implementation of RSES objectives by coordinating appropriate State lands for regeneration and development, opening up key sites which are not being used effectively for housing delivery, and driving strategic land supply and assembly for housing.\nAn Bord Pleanála (ABP): Under Section 143 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, An Bord Pleanála is required to have regard to the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy in the performance of its functions. Section 37 of the Act provides that where a planning authority has decided to refuse permission for development on the grounds that a proposed development materially contravenes the development plan, the Board may grant permission where it considers, inter alia, that permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for the area. Furthermore, under Section 37A, strategic infrastructure developments are dealt with directly by the Board in cases including where the scheduled development would contribute substantially to the fulfilment of any of the objectives in the RSES.\nOffice of the Planning Regulator (OPR): The OPR seeks to secure the objectives of the RSES via the three statutory functions of the Office, namely (a) assessment of statutory plans (b) reviews of local authority planning functions and (c) education, training and research and awareness. The OPR carries out an assessment and evaluation of statutory plans to ensure consistency with national and regional planning policy. These include City and County Development Plans (including Variations) and Local Area Plans (including Alterations).\n\nOPR’s Research, Education, Training and Public Awareness Activity functions: Under Section 31(Q)(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, a core function of the OPR is to conduct education and training programs for elected members and staff of planning authorities and regional assemblies. The OPR training and research program strongly supports the implementation of the Regional Strategic Outcomes (RSO’s) contained within each RSES by upskilling and informing staff, elected representatives and decision makers in local authorities and regional assemblies on the principles, policies and procedures that support the implementation of these policy objectives.\nThe OPR has collaborated with the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG) to develop a tailor-made planning training program for elected members and this included the elected members of the Regional Assemblies. The program currently focuses on topical themes relevant to the members’ role in Making Local Area Plans, Rural transport, Energy and Planning Legislation and Guidance. Furthermore, the OPR, in conjunction with the City and County Managers Association (CCMA), advanced work on the completion of a Learning and Development Strategy for local authority and regional assembly staff. The strategy was finalised in 2022 and issued to the DHLGH, and the chair of the Housing, Building and Land Use Committee of the CCMA. The Learning and Development Strategy was formally published in Q1 of 2023.\n\n\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nA full list of budget allocation for projects approved under the National Development Plan, by region, are accessible to view online within the NDP Projects Tracker, linked herein: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/f828b-myprojectireland-interactive-map/\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nAs previously outlined, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) form part of an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans that are established in legislation, with the National Planning Framework (NPF) at a national level, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) at regional level, and individual city and county plans and local area plans at county level.\nThe Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy’s for each of the three Regional Assembly areas contain the overarching regional development policy framework and specifically identify local opportunities for balanced regional development as well as enhancement/ protection of natural assets, including built heritage and special areas of conservation.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThe current growth strategy of the NPF seeks to shift the spatial pattern of development in Ireland towards more regionally balanced, city focused and compact growth. The strategy is to target population growth split roughly 50:50 between the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly Area (EMRA) and the rest of the Country i.e. the other two Regional Assembly areas (i.e. Southern Regional Assembly (SRA) area; Northern and Western Regional Assembly (NWRA) area). In addition, to encourage more compact and sustainable development, the NPF also targets half of future housing growth that will take place in the five cities to 2040, to be within the existing built footprint of each city, on a combination of what are termed ‘brownfield’ and ‘infill’ development sites.\nThis growth strategy is supported by national ‘Section 28’ Guidelines and key ‘Regional Policy Objectives’ contained within each RSES. In addition, local policy initiatives outlined hereunder within the ‘major regional policy tools’ section of this report, such as the Vacant Site Levy and the Croí Cónaithe (Towns) and (Cities) Funds, further support the delivery of sustainable development in accordance with this overarching strategy across the regions.\nEvolving Policy - Directly Elected Major\nLegislation is currently being prepared to introduce the function of a directly elected mayor for Limerick City and County Council, following approval to create this level of governance by a citizen majority in a plebiscite. A mayoral function for Greater Dublin is also under consideration following recommendations arising from a Citizens’ Assembly consultation process.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nThe National Planning Framework and RSES supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging their growth and prosperity while also seeking to arrest the decline in areas that have experienced low population growth in recent decades. ‘Our Rural Future – Rural Development Policy 2021-2025’ is the new whole-of-Government policy for the sustainable development of rural Ireland, which was launched on 29 March 2021. It contains more than 150 commitments for delivery across Government over a five-year period.\nAs part of Project Ireland 2040 (PI2040) the government has committed to providing an additional €1 billion over the period 2019 to 2027 for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. This will provide investments to renew towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000 people. Underpinned by this significant NDP funding, the RRDF provides an opportunity to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland, to make a sustainable impact in rural communities, and to address depopulation in small rural towns, villages and rural areas. It will be a key instrument to support the objectives of the NPF and RSES relating to Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities.\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nAs outlined above, the legislative basis for the adoption of the RSES as part of the national regional development policy framework is contained within the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Delivery of objectives contained within the three individual RSES is supported through funding mechanisms including the URDF, RRDF and the the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); as well as a range of other Government led initiatives at local government level. Recent local government policy initiatives, which support realization of RSES objectives, include, but are not limited to:\nThe Residential Zoned Land Tax is a new tax aimed at increasing housing supply by activating zoned, serviced residential development lands (including mixed-use lands) for housing. It also aims to incentivise landowners to use existing planning permissions for housing. The tax is being introduced as part of Housing for All, the government's housing plan to 2030. The annual tax will apply at a rate of 3% of the land’s market value.\nThe Vacant Site Levy, introduced by the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which empowers local authorities to compile a vacant site register and to apply a levy to properties listed on the vacant site register. The rate increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant properties from 2019. Site owners became liable to pay from 2020.\nThe Croí Cónaithe (Towns) Fund provides a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties in towns and villages, with priority given to areas with high levels of vacancy or dereliction.\nThe Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Fund launched in May 2022 seeks to increase the supply of owner occupier apartments in cities. The scheme is expected to deliver up to 5,000 additional apartments in the five NPF cities. It will support the Government’s objectives of compact growth and creating vibrant liveable cities. The scheme is targeting the activation of existing planning permissions for apartment developments over four-storeys in height that cost more to build than they can be sold for to individual buyers. The Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme will bridge the viability gap for developments that meet the eligibility criteria. The Government has allocated €450 million for the scheme up to 2026.\nNew Policy Framework - Marine Spatial Planning\nKey developments since the adoption of the RSES have been the publication of the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), and the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021. The NMPF was launched in July 2021 and represents the proposed approach to managing Ireland’s marine activities to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources to 2040. This single framework, bringing together all marine-based human activities, and sets out objectives and planning policies for each activity. Those activities include offshore renewable energy; fisheries; ports, harbors and shipping; safety at sea; sport and recreation; tourism; and wastewater treatment and disposal. The NMPF will be the key decision-making tool for Government departments, state agencies, regulatory authorities and policymakers for decisions on marine activities for all regions.\nThe Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 constitutes the biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the State, with a legal and administrative framework to support a marine environment that Ireland can benefit from socially, environmentally and economically. The Act 2021 establishes a new planning regime for the maritime area and will be a key enabler of decarbonisation of Ireland’s energy sources and the development of offshore energy. It streamlines arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle, i.e. one State consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental assessment.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nDelivery of the RSES objectives are the key policy tool available to Regional Assemblies to co-ordinate, promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development; to make local government and public services more effective and to have an agreed funding and delivery programme for capital projects within their own areas of influence. However, interregional collaboration is also recognised as a core component of the workings of each of the Regional Assemblies. It is recognised that complex strategic objectives of the RSES can only be achieved through collaboration with adjoining regions that have similar objectives and priorities. Good governance and leadership from the Regional Assemblies has contributed to the overall sustainability and viability of interregional and cross border initiatives such as the Association of Irish Regions, which is a collaborative platform representing the three Regional Assemblies at both a political and executive level. This association is made up of the current and former Cathaoirligh of each of the three Regional Assemblies, supported by the Directors of each Assembly.\nThe three Regional Assemblies, under the project management of the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly, have established a Regional Data Hub to monitor the performance of the RSES over its lifecycle and provide a wealth of spatial data for multiple stakeholders using free web-based access. Furthermore, a dedicated RSES Network Group has also been established which provides a forum for the executive of the three Regional Assemblies to progress implementation of the RSESs and related policy and research. This is supported by an Assistant Director Forum made up of the Senior Planners of each Regional Assembly. Ongoing formal and informal cooperation between Regional Assemblies is also not always explicitly linked to the RSES, but also encompasses discussions regarding EU Regional Operational Programmes and the Committee of the Regions.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nPursuant to Section 25A of the Planning and Development Act, as amended, in respect of the regional spatial and economic strategy (RSES) of a regional assembly, public bodies and each local authority within the relevant regional assembly area shall, every 2 years, prepare and submit a report to the assembly setting out progress made in supporting objectives, relevant to that body, of the strategy.\nFollowing receipt of the Section 25A progress reports from public bodies and local authorities, each regional assembly shall, every 2 years, prepare a report (in this section referred to as a monitoring report) monitoring progress made in implementing the regional spatial and economic strategy. The monitoring report shall specify the progress made in securing the overall objectives of the regional spatial and economic strategy, including any specific actions and outcomes, including actions specific to the public bodies including:\n\nthe Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage\nthe Minister for Finance,\nthe Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,\nthe Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation,\nthe Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources,\nthe Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine,\nthe Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport,\nthe Minister for Health,\nthe Minister for Education and Skills,\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade\n\nEach Regional Assembly is required to submit its monitoring report to the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC). The National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC), which was introduced with the Local Government Reform Act 2014, has an independent role in providing evaluations and oversights over the local government sector. NOAC’s functions are wide ranging and involve the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically. The National Oversight and Audit Commission shall consider the monitoring report of the Regional Assembly and may make recommendations to the Minister in relation to relevant measures to further support the implementation of the RSES.\nOngoing Engagement as an Evaluation and Monitoring Tool\nIn addition to the legislative requirements outlined above, members of the Regional Assemblies participate in a Plans Evaluation Forum (the Forum), which was established in June 2019 and is facilitated by the Office of the Planning Regulator. The purpose of the Forum is to facilitate discussion and information sharing in the consideration of statutory plans and encourage greater policy alignment between national, regional and local objectives amongst stakeholders in the context of the local plan making process. Forum members meet approximately every four to six weeks. Regional Assembly staff engage proactively with the forward planning teams in the planning authorities within each regional assembly area to discuss the preparation of the county’s pending development plans and local area plans. The alignment of local plans to the RSES is a key focus of these discussions.\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nPreparatory steps are underway to facilitate a First Revision of the National Planning Framework (NPF), as provided for under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) and committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.\nSpecifically, section 20C (5) of the Planning Act states the following:\nEvery 6 years after the date of publication of the National Planning Framework, the Government shall either—\na) revise the Framework or replace it with a new one, or\nb) publish a statement explaining why the Government has decided not to revise the Framework and include in the statement an indication of a date by which it will be revised or a new National Planning Framework will be published.\nThe first revision of the NPF, which will be facilitated by the release of Census 2022 data, will dictate any future changes to regional policy/RSES objectives."

    "text": "Regional inequality trends\nIn Ireland, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 66%, 60 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to widen. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.  Source: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n \nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Ireland, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions, approximately by the same amount. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).

In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"
