Some opportunities and challenges include:\n\nStructural economic transitions to a net zero economy\nBuilding resilience to natural disasters\nGeographic spread and thin markets for some services\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework provides a guide for investing in regions to make the most of these opportunities and address challenges in a collaborative way, taking account of local voices.\n\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nThe Australian Government’s Regional Investment Framework provides an integrated and coordinated framework for regional development regardless of a region’s economic circumstances with the following guiding principles:\n\nRealising that the Government’s ambition of ‘no one held back and no one left behind’ requires specific regional investment across portfolios.\nAustralia’s regions and their economies are diverse, with each having unique strengths and challenges.\nDelivering on the potential of regional Australia requires building on each regions’ unique strengths, including helping regions undergoing significant economic change to transition or adapt to specific structural challenges.\nPlace-based decision making that draws on the experience of local government alongside regional bodies must guide investment in our regions.\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nResponsibility for the levers that influence regional development (i.e. education, infrastructure, employment services, services, industry and trade) sit across national, state/territory governments and local governments.\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework provides a guide for the Australian Government to work more closely with state, territory and local governments to ensure policy development and delivery is joined up and local voices are taken into consideration.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe 2023-24 Regional Ministerial Budget Statement outlines the Australian Government’s latest investment in regional development across 15 portfolios – specifically 129 new initiatives that improve regional livability, health services and people’s wellbeing, and underpin prosperous economic futures and the transition to net zero. This builds on over 220 packages and initiatives to strengthen regional communities and economies announced in the 2022-23 October Budget.\nMajor recent initiatives include: $1.0 billion for the Growing Regions and regional Precincts and Partnerships programs to fund community infrastructure projects and larger-scale infrastructure investment; $1.9 billion for the Powering the Regions Fund to support regions in their transition to net zero, including $1.4 billion to support industrial decarbonisation; the development of new clean energy industries, and workforce development; and $15.0 billion for the National Reconstruction Fund to diversify industrial capability across seven priority areas, many of which have a significant presence in regional Australia.\nState and Territory governments also provide significant contributions to regional Australia which fund infrastructure and essential services such as health and education.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nThe new Regional Investment Framework enables the Australian Government to take a dedicated focus on investments and initiatives across the spectrum of portfolio areas that support: people, the places they live in, the services they rely on, and the regional industries and local economies that are vital to the nation’s prosperity.\nThe Framework’s guiding principles recognise and respond to the diversity of regions, welcome and incorporate local voices and knowledge, and leverage collective effort across governments, communities and the private sector through genuine partnerships.\nThe Framework embeds regular and frequent engagement across the broad range of Commonwealth portfolios and with other levels of government. This will ensure joined-up approaches that leverage investments, reduce duplication, and deliver cumulative benefits for our regions and their people.\nThis approach is supported by international best practice and the OECD which cites the need for good governance, effective coordination and place-based investment that considers a region’s size, population, etc. to address inequalities, megatrends and future shocks.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThe Australian Government is developing a new National Urban Policy. The National Urban Policy will explore opportunities and challenges facing urban communities and will consider how coordinated action by governments can support more productive, equitable and resilient cities and suburbs.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nRefer to ‘national regional development policy framework’\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nIn line with the Regional Investment Framework, the Australian Government supports regional development through a number of major grant programs, including:\n\nThe regional Precincts and Partnerships Program, which will provide a strategic, nationally consistent mechanism for funding and coordinating projects that transform a place, to benefit communities in regional Australia and help regions move towards net-zero emissions, a decarbonised economy and sustained regional growth.\nThe Growing Regions Program, which provides grants to local government entities and not-for-profit organisations for capital works projects that deliver community and economic infrastructure across regional and rural Australia.\n\nState/territory governments also each have their own specific regional development policy, grant programs and economic development plans.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\nThe Australian Government uses a number of tools to coordinate policy at a national level including:\n\nInterdepartmental Committees, which are a common governance mechanism within the Australian Government to facilitate policy coordination across agencies.\nRegional Australia Impact Statements, which provide a mechanism for Australian Government Cabinet Ministers to receive a summary of the potential impacts that a policy proposal will have on regional Australia and to ensure that their implications and possible mitigation measures are considered in whole-of-Government decision-making.\n\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nExamples of multi-level governance mechanisms used by national and subnational governments include the following:\n\nNational Cabinet is chaired by the Prime Minister with state and territory First Ministers as members, and is used to collaboratively address a wide range of issues of national significance. The Commonwealth and state and territory governments individually have flexibility to determine the best way to achieve any agreed outcomes made by National Cabinet in their jurisdiction.\nRegional Precincts and Partnerships are currently being developed to enable collaboration between all levels of government to achieve a community’s vision.\nThe Regional Deputy Senior Officials Meeting is a mechanism for Australian, state/territory, and local government officials to share information and collaborate to leverage better outcomes for regions.\n\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nA range of policy coordination tools at the regional level exist including:\n\nRegional Development Australia Committees, which are a network of local leaders who work across government, business and community groups to improve their local region. This is achieved by supporting economic and workforce development, local procurement, strategic regional planning and informing government programs and infrastructure investments.\nMany regions also have peak regional advocacy bodies such as ‘One Gippsland’ in the state of Victoria.\n\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nThe Australian Government monitors the effectiveness of its programs and policies through tools including:\n\nMany regional grant programs have evaluation plans to review their effectiveness and determine key lessons for ongoing policy design.\nA centralised evaluation unit is being established in the Australian Government Treasury. This unit will partner with agencies across government to evaluate key programs and support the enablers of high-quality evaluation.\n\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nThe Australian Government’s new Regional Investment Framework released in May 2023 sets the future direction for Australia’s regional policy and focuses on investment in the four following key areas:\n\nPeople – listening to local voices and partnering with communities\nPlaces – supporting adaptive, accessible, sustainable and liveable regions\nServices – enhancing connectivity, accessibility and equity of services\nIndustries and Local Economies – investment to help activate economic and industry growth.\n\nIn addition, the Framework embeds ongoing and regular collaboration and engagement across Australian Government agencies and with state and territory governments. This will help ensure regional development policies are joined up and leverage investment to ensure the best outcomes for regional Australia."

It foresees an amount of 1.3 bio € of Structural Funds support for Austrian programmes which will be co-financed by about 1.8 bio. € of national funds. Specific criteria to enhance an innovative and energy sufficient Austria are principles of circular economy, digitalisation and energy efficiency for selection of projects. Moreover, through the Just Transition Fund the country's transition to a climate-neutral economy through diversification of companies and start-ups to climate neutral and resource efficient activities that provide alternative jobs to replace those in energy intensive industries presently relying on fossil fuels as energy sources will be supported. The European Social Fund will support investments in infrastructures, jobs and education for persons with disabilities, people with migrant backgrounds and other disadvantaged groups. At the local scale, for support of life in cities and rural areas, projects on resource efficiency, climate adaptation, an innovation-oriented economy and local development will be supported. These activities continue on-going activities of several selected regions. On the basis of the long-term strategy document, “ÖREK 2030”, a reorientation in priorities of regional development objectives has started recently and will be implemented over the next years. This includes in particular action on sparing use of land resources throughout the country, and climate action to achieve efficient and resilient resource use objectives. A series of national coordination and strategic planning activities will be implemented. So far, a land use development strategy to reduce the future land consumption and the high level of soil sealing by 2030 has been initiated. The second strategic working group (“Space for building culture”) aims at enhancing the societal role of architectural culture and heritage, in particular to strengthen town and city centres for shaping sustainable and resource efficient options of future spatial development. Due to the specific relevance of landscapes for Austria’s regions, the renewed tourism strategy sets out a vision for this sector, particularly in relation to regional development options. The so-called “Plan T” sets the vision for sustainable tourism development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

In particular, the Flemish Community comprises all the inhabitants of Flanders and Brussels-based Flemings. The French Community comprises all the residents of Wallonia as well as Brussels-based French-speaking inhabitants. The German-speaking Community comprises all the inhabitants of the nine German-speaking municipalities in the east of Belgium.\n\n\nIntermediate-level governments \n10 provinces\nThe intermediary layer of government includes 10 provinces, with five provinces in the Flemish region and five others in the Walloon region. Regions are very diverse in terms of population, size and land mass. The Brussels Capital Region directly exercises provincial responsibilities. The provincial government consists of three main institutions: (i) the provincial council which is the deliberative body elected every six years by direct universal suffrage and chaired by a president (elected among its members); (ii) the permanent deputation (in Flanders) or provincial college (in Wallonia), which is the executive body (its representatives are appointed by the provincial council among their own members); and (iii) the Governor, who is appointed by the regional government. Provinces are themselves sub-divided into administrative districts.\n\n\nMunicipal-level governments \n581 communes\nThe municipal tier of government comprises 581 municipalities, which have been governed by legislation, gradually devolved to the regions since 1980. The deliberative body is the municipal council whose representatives are elected every six years by direct universal suffrage. The executive body is the college of Mayor and aldermen. Aldermen are elected by the municipal council, while the Mayor is nominated according to different rules depending on the region.\nThe number of municipalities has been stable for around 45 years, following a process of compulsory mergers between 1965 and 1983. In particular, the 1975 royal decree reduced the number of municipalities from 2 359 to 596. In 2020, the Flemish Region had 300 municipalities (from 308 following mergers in 2019), while the Walloon region has 262 and Brussels-capital 19. In its 2019 regional policy statement, the Walloon government announced its willingness to encourage municipal mergers on a voluntary basis both by financial and regulatory incentives, as well as by administrative and technical support.\nThe policy of promoting voluntary mergers, is also being implemented in Flanders. The Flemish Coalition Agreement 2019-2024 opts for voluntary mergers because the local governments themselves must be convinced of the need to strengthen their administrative power. That is why the Flemish Government stimulates as many municipalities as possible to merge. It supports the local councils that take the decision and guides and helps them in its implementation by financial and regulatory incentives, as well as by administrative and technical support.\nThe average municipal size in Belgium is almost twice the OECD average municipal size (around 10 250 inhabitants). There are very few small municipalities (1% of less than 2 000 inhabitants) as the majority (72%) have below 20 000 inhabitants.\n\n\nShare of subnational government in total expenditure/revenues (2021)\n49.9% of total expenditure\n51.9% of total revenues\n[Source: Subnational governments in OECD countries: key data, 2023 edition]\nFiscal decentralisation, the devolution of revenue collection and expenditure execution responsibilities from the federal to the regions and the communities, has progressed in stages under six state reforms implemented over five decades.\nWith regards to the revenue side, Regions have several tax including registration duties on sales of real estate, inheritance and gift tax, an annual tax on vehicles and a property tax. Since the last constitutional reform, regions are able to raise surcharges of personal income tax.\n\n\nKey regional development challenges\nBrussels-Capital region\nThe Brussels Government has committed itself to an ambitious global policy aiming to meet the social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the region. Therefore, the various thematic measures and strategic objectives are integrated into a coherent political vision at the level of the Region which, benefitting from inputs of social partners and of civil society, aims to empower all Brussels inhabitants throughout their lives, through access to housing and to quality employment, accessible health care, a healthy and convivial living environment and nearby public and transport infrastructure. More broadly, the environmental issues as well as the challenges imposed by the climate emergency are answered with specific and collective responses, which are part of a long-term approach, in all sectors and in every area of regional competence. From this, some key challenges can be distinguished:\n\nSocio-spatial disparities: urban regeneration policies, inclusion policies and public housing policies\nSustainability, climate change, biodiversity and Economic transition: productive and circular city, city of proximity, climate-neutral city\nDemographic patterns: development of new (social) housing, green spaces and public amenities according to the needs and the diversity of inhabitants\nFinance: the Brussels-Capital Region faces substantial budget constraints as well as a large debt, due to a number of factors, including declining tax revenues and increasing expenditures on social services and infrastructure projects.\nGovernance: Decision making is highly complex + need for greater efficiency\nMobility: multimodality and multi-layer approaches\n\nFlanders\nThe Flemish Resilience Plan is an ambitious investment plan to ensure the transition to a sustainable and digital economy and to make Flanders a warm, inclusive society with people who are more employable on the labour market. The plan defines seven key focal points:\n\nMaking the economy and society more sustainable (Climate, sustainability, and innovation)\nInvesting in infrastructure (The Government of Flanders is investing in infrastructure and major mobility works)\nTransforming Flanders digitally (Digitalization to the maximum extent possible)\nInvesting in people and talents (Promoting lifelong learning and digitalization in education and on the labour market)\nStrengthening Flanders’ care and welfare system (Additional resources for care and welfare)\nManaging the corona crisis and Brexit (Emerging from the corona crisis and Brexit)\nMaking government more efficient (Less red tape and greater efficiency)\n\nWallonia\n\nCarry-out a strong and sustainable economic and industrial policy\nStrengthen independence and energy transition\nGet out of precariousness\nStrengthen training\n\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nEach of the three regions is competent for its regional policy:\nBrussels-Capital Region\nDuring this legislature 2019-2023, the Brussels Government has committed itself to the following objectives:\n\nA region where everyone can live with respect and dignity:\n\nEnsuring that everyone can live at a reasonable price and with public facilities nearby, strengthening the social integration of vulnerable people;\nEnsuring access to stable and sustainable employment\nEnsuring access to healthcare and addressing inequalities\nEnsuring equal rights and combating discrimination effectively\n\nEconomic and social development framed within an ecological transition model:\n\nEconomic innovation at the service of transition: developing an urban economy capable of ensuring prosperity, both by mobilising the strong points and promising sectors and by stimulating the local economy and innovation (circularity, etc.),\nPromote multimodal travel by strengthening active modes of transport, public transport networks and modal rebalancing\nThe climate challenge: An integrated territorial development and environmental policy\nAn energy strategy that relies on the renovation of buildings and the production of renewable energy\n\nA region with a strong identity and an open view of the world, which strengthens its service to its citizens strengthened by striving for manageable institutions that are close to the people.\n\nFlanders\nFlanders is bouncing back, partially thanks to Flemish Resilience. The Government of Flanders’ ambitious investment plan ensures the transition to a sustainable and digital economy. It makes Flanders a warm, inclusive society with people who are more employable on the labour market. Flemish Resilience makes Flanders resilient.\nDespite the five COVID-19 waves and the crisis in Ukraine, the implementation of the Flemish Resilience plan is going largely as planned. 96% of the projects are on schedule; 92% of the initiated milestones have been achieved or are on schedule. Commitments have also risen substantially to 46.5% of the recovery funds or EUR 2 billion. Clear progress has been made again compared to the measurements from March, September, and December 2021.\nThe Flemish Government aims to achieve an 80% employment rate by 2030, in line with the targets in the European Pillar of Social Rights. In 2022, Flanders reached an employment rate of 76.7% for the 20-64 age group. The current Flemish labour market is characterized by a high labour market tightness with labour shortages in some sectors. To ease these shortages and to work towards the 2030 target of 80%, the Flemish Government and the Flemish social partners concluded a new employment agreement ‘Iedereen nodig, Iedereen mee’ in 2022.\nThe employment agreement consists of four pillars: results-oriented active labour market policies form the first pillar. The second pillar revolves around lifelong learning, upskilling and reskilling people to get the right skills for current and future jobs. The Flemish Government wants to reach a 60% rate for training participation by 2030. The third pillar is about ‘workable’ jobs, and improving the quality of work, to enable longer and more fulfilling careers. The fourth and last pillar is centred around economic migration and interregional mobility.\nWith an R&D intensity in 2020 of 3.60% of GDP, Flanders has far exceeded the 3% R&D standard. R&D expenditure in Flanders is almost € 9,59 billion, which is 62% of Belgium’s total R&D expenditure in 2019. Spreading R&D across more sectors and business types remains a challenge for our region. With increasing R&D resources, Flanders aims to advance to the top 5 innovative knowledge regions in Europe.\nWallonia\n\nCapitalise on the youth and talents of Wallonia\nEnsure environmental sustainability\nBoost economic development\nSupport well-being, solidarity and social inclusion\nGuarantee innovative and participatory governance\nSupport the reconstruction and resilience of territories affected by the floods of July 2021\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nThe 1831 Constitution established Belgium as a unitary parliamentary monarchy. A process of federalisation started in the 1970s to take into consideration linguistic, cultural and socio-economic specificities. Six constitutional reforms took place between 1970, 2001 and 2011, the latter taking effect since 2012-2014.\nThe country’s federal structure of government has gradually but significantly evolved over the past decades towards a greater devolution of decision-making power to the six federated entities, made up of three regions (the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region and the Brussels-Capital Region) and three communities (the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking community). The determining characteristic of a region is its geographical area while that of a community is its culture and language.\nAt the federal level, the legislative power is exercised by the Federal Parliament, composed of two assemblies: the Chamber of the Representatives and the Senate. Following the 6th State Reform, members of the Senate (the upper house which serves as a chamber of the communities and regions) are designated by the federated entities (50/60) or co-opted (10/60), and no longer elected (Art. 67 of the Constitution). Senators have no veto powers over federal legislation.\nAt the regional level, there are five legislatures, elected for a five-year term, and five governments, elected by the Parliament, which in turn elects a president: (i) the Flemish Parliament and Government (which represent both the region of Flanders and the Flemish community), (ii) the Walloon Parliament and Government, (iii) the French-speaking Community Parliament and Government (Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles), (iv) the Brussels Region Parliament and Government and (v) the German-speaking Community Parliament and Government. The following can be said with regard to the exercise of the powers of the Flemish and French Communities in the Brussels Capital Region. The Flemish Community Council (Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, VGC) takes care of the responsibilities of the Flemish Community in the Brussels Capital Region. The French Community Commission (COCOF) takes care of the responsibilities of the French Community in the Brussels Capital Region. The Common Community Council (COCOM) regulates and manages matters common to the two Communities in the Brussels Capital Region.\nBelgian federalism severely limits the scope for governments to interfere in subnational levels of responsibilities. The distribution of responsibilities between the regions and communities and the federal level is subject to judicial control, exercised by the Constitutional Court of Belgium, which can annul legislative acts that contravene the division of powers, and by the Council of State, which has the same competence regarding administrative acts contravening the division of powers. The 6th state reform transferred additional responsibilities to regions and communities.\nBrussels-Capital Region\n\nGeneral Policy Statement of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region 2019-2024\nRecovery and redeployment plan to address the Covid-19 crisis\n\nWallonia\nRegional Policy Statement 2019-2024\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe main financial transfer to the regions is the so-called federal personal income tax transfer. Regions with personal income tax yield per capita that are below the national average receive an equalisation transfer (the “National Solidarity Mechanism”) from the federal government. This aims to reduce the revenue gap between the regions and reduce the differences in public service provision. The solidarity mechanism was reformed under the 6th State Reform.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\n\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nSince the 6th State Reform, dating from 2011, the three regions – Flanders, Walloon Region and Brussels Capital Region – are responsible for their own urban policy. Each of the three regions determines its own urban policy autonomously. The regions consult with each other regularly and structurally in matters which need a nationally coordinated point of view, as is – for example, the case with the Urban Development Group (UDG) or the meetings of the Directors-General for Urban Matters (DGUM). As to urban policy, the federal level only has a limited role (mainly knowledge exchange).\nBrussels-Capital Region\nThe main urban policy instruments in the Brussels-Capital Region are:\n\nBrussels Code for Spatial Planning (last change in 2018 and changes under evaluation): it is the main regulation organizing spatial and land-use planning: who does what, which tools, which procedures, which hierarchy of norm…\n\n\nStrategic Plans (non-binding):\n\nRegional Sustainable Development Plan adopted in 2018: the mid and long-term city vision\nMunicipal Development plans: idem for each municipality and must be in compliance with the regional vision.\n\nRegulatory Plans (binding):\n\nRegional Land-use Plan (under revision): define the different uses of land at regional level (under regional direction)\nLocal land-use Plans: they detailed at the level of neighborhoods the Regional Land-use plan (under municipal direction)\n\nStrategic and Regulatory Plans (created in 2018):\n\nMaster Development Plans: instrument uses for big urban projects to define the strategic vision for the development or the area and to develop in parallel a regulatory part to make possible the implementation of the strategic vision and changes the different land—use or other urbanism related regulations.\n\nUrbanism Regulation: Defining the characteristics of the building (volume, aesthetic, height), the norm of habitability of housing, accessibility of building, development of public space, parking in public spaces…\n\nRegional:\n\nRegional urbanism Regulation (under revision): define generic characteristics of new / fully upgraded / renovated buildings\nregional urbanism regulation for specific zones (same with appropriate rules for specific zones (built heritage…)\n\nMunicipal (same tools at municipal level):\n\nMunicipal urbanism regulation\nMunicipal urbanism regulation for specific zones\n\n\n\nWallonia\n\nIntegrated Urban Development Strategy: https://europe.wallonie.be/sites/default/files/2022-03/WAPI_Strategie.pdf\nUrban policy\nTools for urban renewal and revitalisation\n\n\n\nRural policy framework\nBoth rural development and agriculture are regional competences. Part of the policy is determined by the European Union via the CAP: for the period 2023-2027, Belgium is the only member state that has received an exception to draw up 2 CAP plans (instead of 1 plan per member state): a Flemish CAP plan and a Walloon CAP plan.\nFlanders\nRural development issues are also included in the Flemish CAP plan, e.g. LEADER.\nWallonia\n\nWalloon rural policy\nWalloon Rural Development Programme\n\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nBrussels-Capital Region\nWithin the Brussels Capital Region, there are several major regional policy tools, some of the most important are:\n\nGo4Brussels 2030\nShifting economy\nOptiris\nGood Move\nGood Food\nSmall Business Act\nBe Circular\nRenolution\nRegional Plan for Innovation\n\nOne of the main economic polies is embedded in Shifting Economy, the regional strategy for the economic transition (https://shiftingeconomy.brussels/). The strategy gathers more than 200 measures, aimed at helping the Brussels economic actors becoming exemplary on the social and environmental level. By 2030, no more public money will flow to economic actors who don't have exemplary business models. So that, by 2050, we reach a decarbonised and regenerative economy. Shifting Economy has been adopted on 31 March 2021 and is part of the reforms of the Belgian Recovery and Resilience Plan. The first evaluation of Shifting Economy is planned for 2024.\nIn addition, congestion is considered a problem by the region and the nuisances (environmental, noise, financial, etc.) it causes are taken seriously. The main strategies the region is putting in place are described in the Good-Move regional mobility plan. For example, the dynamic traffic flow management project aims to control this congestion in order to limit the various impacts. Mobility scenarios (modification of traffic lights, user information, implementation of diversions, etc.) have been developed and are activated for recurrent events (e.g. tunnel closure). Mobility managers\" are active in our control center during peak hours or for incident management. They are able to remotely adapt traffic light regimes in real time to better control traffic and thus reduce congestion.\nThe OPTIris programme stands for \"Optimising the Performance and Transition of Institutions\". It aims to respond to the challenges the Region will face in the future through reforms that will also enable structural savings of €60 million a year within the perimeter of the regional entity.\nFlanders\nThe Flemish Region is responsible for the general financing of cities and municipalities. In Flanders this concerns the Municipal Fund and a number of other endowments that are provided without conditions to the Flemish cities and municipalities (and their Public Centers for Social Welfare). In Flanders, this will amount to just over 4 billion euros (4,040,054,000) in 2022. In comparison, in 2021 the total revenue of the Flemish cities and municipalities amounted to 15,587,715,901 euros.\nIn addition to this general, condition-free basic funding, various parts of the Flemish Authority also provide various specific, condition-related subsidies to the cities and municipalities. In Flanders, these subsidies (both the number and the size) have increased in recent years, partly as a result of the policy option to intervene in the extra expenditure of Flemish cities and municipalities as a result of the Covid-19 crises.\nThe Flemish Authority is also responsible for determining the way in which the cities and municipalities draw up their multiannual plan (and its annual adjustments), keep their accounts and draw up their annual accounts. In Flanders, this system is called BBC – policy and management cycle. The Government of Flanders specifically supervises the (adapted) multi-year plans and annual accounts. The (adjusted) multi-annual plans must have a positive self-financing margin at the end of the planning period. The cities and municipalities are also obliged to digitally provide certain data of the policy reports to the Government of Flanders.\nWallonia\n44 strategies and plans: https://developpementdurable.wallonie.be/sites/dd/files/2022-09/SWDD3_2022_CH2_strat%C3%A9gies-plans_0.pdf\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\nThere are a number of inter-governmental coordination mechanisms. A Concertation Committee has been made up with respect for linguistic parity:\n\nthe Government represented by the Prime Minister and five of its members appointed by royal decree deliberated in the Council of Ministers;\nthe Flemish government represented by its minister president and one of its members;\nthe government of the French Community represented by its minister president\nthe government of the Walloon region represented by its minister president;\nthe government of the Brussels-Capital Region represented by its President and one of its members belonging to the other linguistic group.\n\nThe local governments (municipalities, provinces) are represented by their associations in their respective region (a \"united\" national association also exists) and participate in committees at the federal level, although no formal consultation mechanism is in place.\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between federal and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nThe set of agreements on position-taking and representation in the EU was laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Belgian authorities in 1994. The starting point is the constitutional principle in foro interno, in foro externo, which extends the division of powers within Belgium to foreign policy. Such a cooperation agreement in which all governments co-decide and represent on an equal footing according to internal division of powers is completely unique in Europe. Since 1994, the agreement has been modified to a limited extent. However, the reforms of the Belgian state that further shift the centre of gravity towards the regional levels and the changes to the European system by the Lisbon Treaty require adjustments to this agreement.\nInter-ministerial conferences are the main governance bodies between the federal, regional and community levels. They include for instance the Interministerial conference on sustainable development and the Interministerial conference on foreign policy.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nWallonia\nThere are several tools, usually linked to plans and strategies, including the Steering Committee of the Walloon Recovery Plan, the Walloon Partnership for Sustainable Development for the 3rd Walloon Sustainable Development Strategy and the Standing Conference on Territorial Development (CPDT)\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nBrussels-Capital Region\nThe BISA is the reference centre for statistics for the Brussels-Capital Region. It identifies the authorities' needs and users' questions. In addition, BISA collects data from about 100 different suppliers (Federal, Regional, Communities, etc.) in order to develop, handle and produce public statistics completely independently. It carries out public policy evaluations entrusted to it by the Brussels-Capital Government or by order. These evaluations are a tool for taking decisions in order to improve the public policies implemented.\nThe structural embedding of spending reviews in the budgetary processes of the various entities of our country was included as a structural reform in the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience, becoming thus also an obligation, with concrete milestones and timing. From 2023, the goal is to integrate spending reviews into the budget process through the systematic inclusion of the results of spending reviews in annual and multi-year budget planning, starting from the preparation of the budget ordinance for the 2024 fiscal year. This will include ex-post quantification of the results, including savings, associated with the spending review programme.\nFlanders\nThe implementation of the Flemish Recovery Plan is being closely monitored, using two measurement moments per year. The latest monitoring report submitted to the Flemish Government in February 2023 shows that the implementation of the Flemish resilience projects is very much on track: for instance, 97% of the projects are in execution following a decision by the Flemish Government or have been realised and 95% of the projects have been budgeted. The Flemish Government is also closely monitoring the recovery via the online dashboard: 36 indicators give a picture of the evolution of the economic and social situation in Flanders in 4 areas (macroeconomic and budgetary control, sustainable growth, inclusive growth, healthy growth).\nThe Flemish Broad Budgetary Reconsideration and expenditure reviews will become a structural evaluation practice in Flanders. With the adaptation of the Flemish Public Finance Codex in 2022, they were defined and structurally embedded in the Flemish budgetary process.\nWallonia\n\nProgress review on the SDGs\nEvaluation programme of the Walloon Recovery Plan (IWEPS)\nWork of the High Strategic Council on the ex-ante evaluation of employment, climate and poverty\n\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy"

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.032 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.023 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.615. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.025 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.135. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.006 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.163 in 2020 and increased by 0.048 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions.

Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 15%, 6 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Belgium, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions while the opposite was true for the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\n\nBrussels-Capital Region The support measures taken by the Brussels Government in the recent months and years have taken to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, as well as the targeted measures the Government decided for the year 2023 to deal with the inflation we are currently experiencing, have and will have an impact on the financial situation of the Region. Despite these developments, it remains the objective of the Brussels Government to return to a balanced budget in 2024. The multi-year rationalisation processes aimed at greater efficiency and effectiveness of public spending (in particular through spending reviews) will be continued. With \" Shifting Economy \" the Brussels government is paving the way for the transformation of the Brussels economy to make it carbon-free, regenerative, circular, social, democratic and digital. In order not to stifle economic recovery and promote a sustainable inclusive growth, the Brussels Government continues to invest in mobility, social housing employment policy and the implementation of the climate plan. To finance the relaunch, the Brussels Capital Region make maximum use of the Facility for Recovery and Resilience. As stated in the 2019-2024 General Policy Statement, the Government intends to make two changes in social and health policies: a social shift aimed at reducing social inequalities and an organizational shift aimed at better organizing healthcare and social action, ensuring accessibility, quality, and sustainability of care. This dual shift is implemented within a global program embodied by the Brussels Integrated Social-Health Plan (PSSI), which is common to the (Common Community Commission) COCOM and the COCOF (French Community Commission)), regarding social action and health. The PSSI, adopted in July 2022, proposes a framework aiming to involve all services present on the territory to direct social-health policies in an integrated and coherent manner, in a logic of territorial basins and neighbourhood groups. It is structured around four axes:  Improving quality of life and health and reducing social health inequalities; Guaranteeing access to rights and services; Improving the structure and coordination of aid and care services ; Co-building an integrated social-health policy.  In terms of gender equality, in December 2022 the Brussels government adopted the first Brussels plan for gender mainstreaming and equality between women and men. Supported by the voluntary sector, which was largely involved in its development, this Plan proposes 69 very concrete cross-cutting actions to ensure better inclusion of the gender dimension in public policies. The new management contracts of Actiris and Bruxelles Formation for the period 2023-2027 will contribute to the commitment made by Belgium to achieve, by 2030, an employment rate of over 80% for people aged 20 to 64. In addition, the Go4Brussels 2030 strategy aims to \"guarantee access to stable and sustainable employment for all\". In this context, a specific initiative is dedicated to combating discrimination in hiring and promoting diversity. The principles and essential rights included in the European Pillar of Social Rights (chapter \"equal opportunities and access to the labour market\") that promote the development of fair and effective labour markets and social protection systems, also play a crucial role in this respect and aim to ensure that all Brussels talents have equal access to stable and quality employment. In addition, the regional Employment Qualification strategy will be launched in 2023 with a view to further strengthening the level of skills of job seekers and meeting the growing demands of the metropolitan labour market. In 2023, the Brussels Government aims to modernize the matter of paid educational leave in order to make it an effective training tool throughout one's career and to make it more accessible and inclusive (gender, disability, online training, part-time workers, etc.). Finally, an evaluation of all employment aids (including those specifically aimed at job seekers and workers with disabilities) is being finalized and could lead to the revision of certain regulations in order to adapt them to the current realities of the job market, benefiting job seekers who are far from the labour market. Flanders The Flemish government is resolutely opting to keep public finances healthy and strengthen structural growth in our country. A budgetary path has been mapped out whereby Flanders returns to a balanced budget from 2027 onwards (excluding the investment expenditure related to Oosterweel). The Flemish Broad Budgetary Review and expenditure reviews are not one-off or non-binding exercises but will become a structural evaluation practice in Flanders. With the adaptation of the Flemish Public Finance Codex in 2022, they were defined and structurally embedded in the Flemish budgetary process. Meanwhile, the Resilience Plan totalling €4.3 billion is being implemented, including the 55 projects funded by European RRF funds. Despite the five COVID-19 waves and the crisis in Ukraine, the implementation of the Flemish Resilience plan is going largely as planned. 96% of the projects are on schedule; 92% of the initiated milestones have been achieved or are on schedule. As said the Flemish Government aims to achieve an 80% employment rate by 2030, in line with the targets in the European Pillar of Social Rights. In 2022, Flanders reached an employment rate of 76.7% for the 20-64 age group.The current Flemish labour market is characterised by a high labour market tightness with labour shortages in some sectors. To ease these shortages and to work towards the 2030 target of 80%, the Flemish Government and the Flemish social partners concluded a new employment agreement ‘Iedereen nodig, Iedereen mee’ in 2022. The employment agreement consists of four pillars: results-oriented active labour market policies form the first pillar. Measures from the agreement include the introduction of a social security contribution reduction for employers that hire someone without recent lasting work experience. On the topic of active labour market policies, the Flemish Government has also introduced the ‘jobbonus’ to increase the financial difference between working and not working. It is a cash premium for people with a low labour income. To achieve an employment rate of 80%, some more vulnerable groups need to be included in the labour market as well. Flanders is introducing ‘individual adapted work’ (individueel maatwerk), a tailored employment support system for people with health conditions and/or occupational disabilities. The second pillar revolves around lifelong learning, upskilling and reskilling people to get the right skills for current and future jobs. In 2021, the Action plan for Lifelong Learning was launched, which provides a coherent and mobilising framework for all partners involved in the realisation of a learning culture in Flanders. The Flemish Government wants to reach a 60% rate for training participation by 2030. The third pillar is about ‘workable’ jobs, and improving the quality of work, to enable longer and more fulfilling careers. The fourth and last pillar is centred around economic migration and interregional mobility, which can provide opportunities in a tight labour market. With Flanders Technology & Innovation, Flanders presents itself as the technology laboratory of the world and aims to tackle five major societal challenges: climate and energy (energy tech), health (health tech), education and labour market (Flanders Next Academy), data and digitisation (data tech) and entertainment and media (entertainment tech). Five thematic symposia will be organised around these themes. Major public events are then planned in March 2024, spread across the five Flemish provinces. Wallonia Launch of the Walloon Recovery Plan thanks to the pooling of three action programmes (Get up Walonia, Walloon Transition Plan, Facility for Recovery and Resilience). The Walloon recovery plan has been completed with a 6th strategic axis focusing exclusively on the reconstruction of the disaster areas affected by the extreme weather of July 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nGiven the country’s vast geography, regionalism has always been part of the political and social landscape of Canada. Nation-wide approaches to economic development do not fully address the differing regional circumstances. As such, Canada takes a place-based approach to economic development with responsibilities across different orders of government and across a range of departments, ministries and agencies, including the federal government’s seven regional development agencies. Federal regional economic development programs are complementary to national programming. In addition, Canada’s provinces and territories play an important role in economic development with exclusive responsibilities over an array of matters within their jurisdictions. There are several complementary economic development initiatives offered by federal, provincial and territorial governments. It is not possible to capture all initiatives within the scope of this document. Provinces and territories also have shared responsibilities with the federal government in areas such as old age pensions, agriculture, and immigration. Rural and remote communities are crucial to the economic success of Canada, contributing about 25 percent of the country's GDP in 2019. In 2019, Canada introduced the first federal Minister of Rural Economic Development to pursue and advance initiatives that recognize the unique realities and challenges faced by rural communities, including measures to support economic recovery, growth and resilience. Key among these measures is providing access to fast and reliable high-speed Internet. As a result of the Universal Broadband Fund and other federal and provincial investments, Canada is on track to meet its goal of providing high-speed Internet access to 98 percent of Canadian households by 2026 and 100 percent by 2030. Additionally, the Minister of Rural Economic Development is mandated to support more visible and accessible service delivery in areas such as rural transit solutions, postal services, mental health services, and housing. To support the Minister in her mandate, the Centre for Rural Economic Development (CenRED) was established to help integrate rural needs and realities into the policy development process at the federal level by engaging across government and with rural communities and experts. Canada’s Rural Economic Development Strategy, entitled Rural Opportunity, National Prosperity was released in June 2019, outlining the whole-of-government approach that the Government of Canada is taking to meet the economic, social development, and sustainability needs of rural Canada. The progress report, released in August 2021, outlines progress made and next steps to ensure that Canada’s rural and remote communities are resilient and have access to tools necessary to reach their full economic potential. Canada’s seven Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) were created by the federal government to address key economic challenges by providing regionally tailored programs, services, knowledge and expertise. Each agency brings a regional policy perspective in support of the national agenda by contributing regional economic intelligence to support national decision-making; providing targeted investments to local businesses, organizations, and communities; and, contributing to cooperative relationships with other levels of government, community and post-secondary institutions, and other stakeholders. In 2021, the Government of Canada separated the former Western Economic Diversification Canada into two distinct RDAs, Pacific Economic Development Canada (PacifiCan) for the province of British Columbia, and Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) for the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. This decision recognized that economic drivers and conditions are unique in the different regions, and that entrepreneurs, innovators, institutions, and communities need access to place-based support. RDAs took action to support business and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, they provided immediate liquidity support for businesses through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). They then provided targeted programs such as the Jobs and Growth Fund (JGF) to help job creators and the organizations that support them build resiliency and prepare for growth, the Canada Community Revitalization Fund (CCRF) to support local community infrastructure rejuvenation and development, and Tourism Relief Fund (TRF) to help tourism operators safely welcome back visitors after the pandemic by adjusting their operations to meet public health guidance and increase accessibility. Increasingly, the Government of Canada is prioritizing investment to build a cleaner and green economy. RDAs have an important role to play in achieving this objective. For example, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) is accelerating small and medium sized enterprises’ green transition, helping Canada to reach its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In addition, Prairies Economic Development Canada is leading work under the Building a Green Prairie Economy Act to enhance federal, regional, and local cooperation on initiatives that support regional economic growth and the creation of sustainable, well-paying jobs across the prairie provinces.” As part of the Innovation and Skills Plan, RDAs have made investments in clean technology projects, supporting innovative start-ups to commercialize clean technology while creating sustainable local jobs. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms the human rights of Indigenous Peoples. On June 21st, 2021, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (UNDRIP) received Royal Assent and came into force. This Act provides a roadmap for the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples to work together to implement the Declaration based on lasting reconciliation, healing, and cooperative relations. At a regional level, Canada’s RDAs support and work in partnership with Indigenous peoples.    The Government of Canada recognizes that Indigenous self-government is part of Canada’s evolving system of cooperative federalism and distinct orders of government.↩︎ Provinces receive their power and authority from the 1867 Constitution Act, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada. Allocation of powers is specified in the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982 – provinces have exclusive legislative jurisdiction over a large array of matters within their regions, such as hospitals, education, natural resources, and municipal affairs. Provinces and territories also have some concurrent powers with the federal government, including old age pensions, agriculture and immigration. For more details see: The constitutional distribution of legislative powers↩︎ This is the enabling legislation for both Prairies Economic Development Canada and Pacific Economic Development Canada.↩︎ Budgets for the year 2021-2022 are higher than previous years due to the Government of Canada’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.↩︎ Pacific Economic Development Canada was created in August 2021.

In a transition period through transitory article 5, of Law No. 21,074, on Strengthening the Regionalization of the Country, the President of the Republic exercised the power given to individualize 15 powers to transfer to Regional Governments, from the ministries of Housing and Urban Development (MINVU), Transport and Telecommunications (MTT); in the Corporation for the Promotion of Production (CORFO); in the Technical Cooperation Service (SERCOTEC); and in the Solidarity and Social Investment Fund (FOSIS)”. These were transferred through their respective supreme decrees, temporarily. Since the beginning of his administration, the government of President Gabriel Boric promotes the Forum for Decentralization, as a collaborative instance of permanent work with the Governors and Governors, favoring political-technical dialogue that allows in the short term to advance towards an effectively decentralized Chile. . The purpose of this instance is to agree on a common roadmap regarding the process of transferring powers. Specifically, identify a set of prioritized and agreed powers, which will be presented to the President of the Republic and officiated at the Inter-ministerial Decentralization Committee, to be submitted for evaluation and eventually transferred. Likewise, taking into account the priority assigned to decentralization as one of the four axes of the government program, the executive considers the elaboration of a National Decentralization Policy that marks the orientations and commitments for the coming years, the presentation of a draft Regional Income Law, and the strengthening of local finances    https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1017683&idVersion=1955-06-21↩︎ The Government Plan has four transversal perspectives that run through each of its proposals towards the search for social justice and decentralization of power: feminism, just ecological transition, decentralization and guarantee of decent work.

In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nColombia’s National Development Plan 2022-2026 includes measures and actions aimed to transform and strengthen the technical capacity of subnational governments. In particular, the National government wants to develop a model of differential decentralization that allows the promotion of territorial autonomy. Also, it seeks to advance in a policy to build and improve territorial planning from a new management approach under the following principles: i) protection of water and environmental justice, ii) Human security and social justice, iii) the right to food, iv) productive transformation and climate action, and v) regional convergence To promote strategic investment projects, the government will aim to align the general budget of the nation, intergovernmental grant system, and the general system of royalties. In this way, the National government will prioritise historically marginalised territories, the municipalities with high levels of informality and of rurality, and allows the full enjoyment of rights of the inhabitants in each of the territories. In addition to the above, several policies and governance mechanisms have already been implemented in the last two decades to promote and address regional capacities and local development. For instance, the promotion of local and regional association initiatives, policy frameworks to promote national cities development (such as Sistema de Ciudades), the regulation of multipurpose cadastre orientated to promote local development and to endorse economic benefits from land use exploitation. Colombia's Decentralisation Mission, established in 2021, is working to propose reforms to promote subnational development and reduce regional inequality. The mission's key areas of focus include:  Competencies throughout government levels Sources and uses of revenues for local development Institutional architecture and modernization of public administration Open government and citizen participation Decentralisation and indigenous territories  Also, since the signing of the peace agreement, Colombia has been implementing rural development policies through the Development Programs with a Territorial Focus (PDET) and advancing towards comprehensive rural reform and the strengthening of agricultural policies (Ley 2183 de 2022). Finally, Colombia has worked to promote and strengthen digital enablers to improve access, use and appropriation of ICTs in a digitally secure environment. In 2021, Law 2108 was issued, declaring Internet access as an essential public service, and public policies have been formulated to promote Internet access and use in the most remote areas of the country. Later, in 2022, the National Data Infrastructure Plan and its governance model were issued in order to promote the use and exploitation of data; in addition, a new Digital Government Policy was developed, and guidelines were defined to strengthen the governance of digital security, as well as risk management and response to cyber incidents.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nOne of the main and recent policy development in Costa Rica is the entry into force of the Regional Development Law No. 10.096, which brings a twist to managing development because of its emphasis on subnational areas, particularly on the planning regions. This law reinforces the Regional Planning Subsystem and provides new tools for addressing internal and external regional development gaps. Some of these tools are the Regional Development Fund, the regional budgets, the regional GDP index, the Regional Development Observatory, the National Regional Development Policy, the Study to update the regionalisation scheme of the country, the Regional Development Agencies and its coordination mechanisms between national and regional levels. Furthermore, the law establishes the concept, objective and axes for regional development in Costa Rica, as well as provisions for development planning and budgeting, considering the regional level. The implementation of the law is underway. Finally, two additional initiatives contribute to regional development. The first is the National Clusters Program, led by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MTSS), which focuses on facilitating collaboration to improve productivity, competitiveness, innovation, linkages and employment at the national and territorial levels. The second initiative is the Law to Strengthen Territorial Competitiveness to Promote the Attraction of Investments Outside the Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM), No. 10234, led by the Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

Additional resources, though minimal in comparison, come from other budgetary sources. The regional policy is guided by the “Regional Development Strategy 21+”, which was approved by the government in late 2019. To guide the management of structure funds, a special document called “Territorial dimension of operational programmes”, approved by the government, stipulates compulsory regional investments, especially in the area of integrated tools (Integrated Territorial Investment and Community-led Local Development). The government has made regional policy a key priority of its agenda and has set out some new directions, including to incorporate territorial impact assessment in legislation procedures and to establish a new initiative called “Government committee on regional policy”, which should strengthen the Ministry for Regional Development vis-a-vis other line ministries so as to enforce regional policy interests across all government investments and other activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

Municipalities are the only subnational level to raise tax revenues, as opposed to regions who have no taxation powers.\n66.5% of total expenditure\n62.4% of total revenues\n[Source: Subnational governments in OECD countries: key data, 2023 edition]\n\n\nKey regional development challenges\nRegional urbanization: an increasing part of the population lives in or close to the major cities which results in local schools and stores closing in rural areas continuously and reducing the job supply.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nImproving the cohesion between rural and urban areas by evening out economic, financial and demographic differences to address the depopulation of rural and remote areas.\nIn 2021, the Danish government set up seven regional teams with the objective of recommending ways to cultivate regional business strengths. The growth teams recommended establishing 8 local business “lighthouses” consisting of wide partnership with the objective of supporting the development of future sector strongholds and emerging industries.\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nStructural reform of 2007 (Kommunalreformen), which significantly changed the institutional and territorial organisation of the country.\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 174\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe Danish Regions have budgeted with 400 million € for regional development and close to 1 billion € in capital investment, while the municipalities have estimated expenditures of 2.5 billion € for capital investments.\nMunicipality equalisation reform of 2020, see recent policy developments.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nThe Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement 2021-2027: 656 million € of EU Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF+, JTF, EHFAF) and 40 million € (expected) annual national co-funding.\nThe Danish Business Authority, the Danish Authority of Social Services and Housing, the Danish regions and the Danish Fisheries Agency are the primary administrative authorities of the aforementioned funds.\nEach of the five regions formulate a regional development strategy every 3-4 years. There is no national strategic document although it has been a clear political priority of the government to ensure balanced regional development in recent years.\nAs part of a wider reform of the public sector administration, nine municipalities (number extended later) took part in a policy experiment called the “Free Municipality” initiative. They were granted exemptions from government rules and bureaucracy requirements with the aim to review potential future legislation simplifying.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nRevitalisation of town centers in small and medium sized towns has received increased national attention in the last ten years. National focus has, first of all, been directed towards improving the regional cohesion and balance through infrastructure developments, decentralization of public institutions and through business development.\nSecondly, on town level, attention has been on the access to private and public services such as shops, schools and health facilities. Inspired by a place-based development framework the government has encouraged municipalities to strengthen private-public partnerships and to identify place-based qualities and strategies. Two examples of such policy tools are the urban renewal scheme and the “Partnership for thriving town centers” (2020-2022).\n\n\nRural policy framework\nCAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 (Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs and The Danish Agency for Planning and Rural Development). As part of the CAP Strategic Plan: 62 million € for local rural development projects which are implemented through local action groups.\nIn 2019, the Danish government issued the Business Promotion Act with the purpose of improving the conditions for business owners, enhancing productivity and export and avoid overlapping regional development and business promotion initiatives.\nThe responsibility of business promotion was transferred from the regions to national level (Danish Board of Business Development) in 2019. The responsibility for business promotion is now divided between municipalities (local business services) and the state (specialized business service).\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nDenmark's approach to regional development prioritises the competitiveness of all of its regions. A high share of EU Cohesion Policy funding is dedicated to this objective, along with other instruments such as business development centers and publicly funded clusters based on Sector Strongholds and Emerging Industries.\nPolicy tools:\n\nNational technology and innovation clusters\nRegional business development centres\nA national online guide for business (Virksomhedsguiden).\nDevelopment of smaller cities and tourism infrastructure.\nProjects of strategic importance (business “lighthouses”)\n\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\nA National Board for Business Promotion was established in 2019 to allow for a clearer strategic focus to improve competitiveness across regions while taking local and regional specificities into account.\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nThe existence of the National Board of Business Promotion is determined by law but the members of the board are determined collaboratively by business organisations, municipalities, unions, etc.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nBoth the national association of municipalites, the Danish regions, and the regional business development centres are important partners in determining the joint direction of regional development. The regional business development centers will also be responsible for the municipalities’ business service and activities for 13 locations across the country.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nAs the administrative authority, the Danish Business Authority continously performs evaluations and measurements of the effects of regional development projects funded by European Structural Funds combined with national co-funding.\nAll projects funded by the European Structural Funds exceeding a monetary threshold is evaluated by an external evaluator. Furthermore, the Danish Business Authority estimates the socioeconomic effect on all participating businesses in collaboration with the Danish National Statistics Office (Statistics Denmark).\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nThe National Board of Business Promotion formulates a national strategy for Business Promotion for the period 2024-2027, which is expected to include:\n\nImproving the complementarities between the funds and the policy instruments to simplify being an enterprise in Denmark.\nImproving and cultivating sector strongholds.\nImproving the digital and green robustness and adaptation readiness of the Danish enterprises.\nImproving the geographical availability of regional development initiatives."

There has been no significant trend towards territorially more balanced development in recent years also.\n• More active economic activity and attractive/profitable jobs are concentrating in larger urban regions, and regional differences in economic growth are deepening.\n• Demographic changes, especially internal migration of younger people towards largest urban areas are generating regional shrinkage outside major urban areas and is weakening the development prospects of these shrinking regions.\n• Local governance, investment and development capacity (e.g in delivery of quality public services) is still uneven across municipalities. Municipalities in larger urban areas with more favourable demographic structure have normally higher and remote, sparsely populated municipalities located further away from cities lower capacity.\n• There are still shortcomings in the coordination of the regional impact of sectoral policies in the goals of balanced regional development.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\n• Diminishing regional development disparities;\n• Strengthening cities’ role in development of larger regions through proximity effects/urban-rural interactions and promoting smart shrinkage of regions facing depopulation;\n• Strengthening coordination of regional policy objectives across national sectorial policies and levels of governance (as multilevel governance of regional development);\n• Promoting financial autonomy of local municipalities and reducing the political dependency from the central government when it comes to the formation of their tax base;\n•Transferring some complementary state government responsibilities/functions to local municipalities and increasing decentralisation in public governance, along with ensuring the necessary revenue base;\n• Increasing the role of local governments and their responsibilities in the development of the business environment and ensuring appropriate instruments and funds\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nThe Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture is responsible for developing, implementing, coordinating and monitoring regional development, spatial planning and territorial administration policy and developing and counselling local municipalities of Estonia. The Ministry is also in charge of the issues of territorial administration and setting financial management principles for local authorities. The Ministry also designs and coordinates the implementation of regional development (e.g. rural and urban areas) grant schemes and development of regional public transport.\nThe other ministries also contribute to development of regions and cities by coordinating specific sectorial policies having a stronger territorial relevance:\n• Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is responsible for housing, urban transport, business development, energy, ICT and digital society, innovation and R&D policies having significant importance to development of regions;\n• Ministry of the Environment, as coordinating environmental, sustainable development, adaptation/mitigation of climate change, circular economy and mobility, as well as housing and energy policies;\n• Ministry of Social Affairs, as being responsible for social protection, labour market and lifelong learning policies, e.g. developing labour market grand schemes.\nMinistry of Education and Research, as being responsible for education policy, school network and R&D policies and relevant funding instruments.\nLocal municipalities are responsible for spatial and strategic development planning and provision of local public services within their territories. Local municipalities also coordinate strategic development at county level jointly through County Development Organisations.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nPresumably around 70-80 million euros will be allocated to regional development annually during the next 7-years implementation period of the EU funds specifically through the regional development grant schemes (funded from the EU funds as well as from the national budget). This calculation does not include the other sectorial policy grants reaching also to different regions of Estonia.\nThe fiscal equalisation mechanism forms 107,4 million euros (2023), which represents 3,6% of total local government income.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nSince 2021 we have no longer had a holistic national regional development strategy being valid for all sectorial ministries. Nevertheless, regional development goals, e.g to ensure a more balanced territorial development and consideration of different territorial needs through sectorial policy strategies is set within the National Development Strategy “Estonia 2035”.\nThere is also a new Regional Development Action Plan (RDAP) in place since 2022. The RPAP defines the most eminent socio-economic inequalities of regional development seen as major challenges/root-problems of regional development in Estonia, and creates a framework for monitoring these processes. It also sets more detailed 4-year action plan covering different sectorial policy activities to alleviate these root problems and support more even regional development.\nBesides, there is a regional development program for 4-year period (being updated annual-basis), which sets up the implementation plan for the ministry responsible for regional policy in Estonia (Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture). This document is also a basis for planning 4-years state budget strategy.\nAt regional level there are 15 county1 development strategies in place, developed jointly by the local municipalities of the county. Although there is a general requirement that the county development strategies and national level policy strategies are consistent and consider each other’s priorities, there are no binding mechanisms to ensure this in practice.\nThere is no official regional policy council or advisory group or other such institution currently in Estonia at government level coordinating the development and implementation of regional policy across sectorial ministries and levels of governance.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nEstonia does not have an explicit national urban policy or national strategy for urban development. The urban development issues have addressed within a broader national regional policy framework.\nE.g. specific grant schemes for development of 5 largest urban areas of Estonia are applied being funded from the European Regional Development Fund of 2021-27. These grant schemes aim to support investments in innovative digital solutions and green infrastructure of Estonian largest urban areas and revitalization of the largest urban areas in North-Eastern Estonia.\nOne soft coordination initiative is a national network of urban development specialists. This is an informal multilevel governance and collaboration platform, assembling officials of urban municipalities in charge or strategic development and spatial planning of their cities/towns and the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities. And involving also the representatives from central government body responsible for regional and urban development policy, other relevant ministries.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nRural development policy is being implemented primarily under the national strategy for Rural Development and Fishery 2030.\nRural development is under the primary responsibility of the Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture. The ministry e.g. coordinates Estonia’s rural development policy, implements the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy for Estonia and develops/implements the Estonian strategic Rural Development Plans.\nRural development is also an integral part of the national regional policy and its incentives. The Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture is in charge of designing and implementing territorial development policies which is largely addressed to specificities and challenges of rural areas.\nBesides, other ministries have their own sectorial responsibilities related to developments in rural areas.\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\n• Regional development grant schemes (funded from the EU funds as well as from the national budget);\n• Fiscal equalisation mechanism to local governments;\n• National Regional Development Action Plan;\n• National Development Plans for North-Eastern and South-Eastern regions of Estonia until 2030;\n• A mechanism and guideline document for impact assessment of legislative acts and national policy strategies, which e.g requires assessment of impacts on regional development and rural areas and provides a respective check-out questionnaire.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\n• National Regional Development Action Plan (RDAP) aimed at facilitating the cross-sectorial coordination of policy incentives in regional policy and balanced territorial development goals. The RDAP consolidates the most important activities of the central government in order to alleviate the problems of regional development and ensure territorially more balanced development.\n• National Development Plans for North-Eastern and South-Eastern regions of Estonia until 2030;\n• According to the Government of the Republic Act planning and general co-ordination of regional development lies under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.\n• Mechanism and guideline document for impact assessment of legislative acts and national policy strategies, which e.g requires assessment of impacts on regional development and rural areas.\n• The national Government has given a task to the sectorial ministries to take into account the regional development challenges and impacts in designing foreign aid support measures funded from the EU funds of 2021-2027 and plan concrete solutions to strengthen their compliance with the balanced territorial development target. A special guideline has also been prepared for this process with providing potential solutions how to promote this compliance in practice.\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\n• Annual National Budget negotiation format between national Government and National Association of Cities and Municipalities.\n• A national network of County Development Organisations (as soft coordination mechanism), which represent local municipalities of each certain county and performs also as a multilevel collaboration and policy discussions with ministries. The network convenes regularly mainly to exchange important information, best practices, initiate consultations on different territorial development related issues between counties (horizontally) and with the ministries (vertically).\n• Similar national network of urban development specialists also exists assembling officials of urban municipalities in charge or strategic development and spatial planning of their cities/towns and the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities. And involving also the representatives from central government body responsible for regional and urban development policy, other relevant ministries.\n• The principles of how national level sectoral development strategies, county development strategies and local government development plans have to consider and support each other's priorities and strive towards stronger coherence are specified in new draft of Local Governments Act, the strategic planning guidelines issued by the State Government Office and guidelines for preparation of county development strategies.\n• Recently established (in 2022) steering group at national level for coordinating the capacity building of local government employees for planning, implementing and monitoring the specific Action-Plan for local governments capacity building.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\n• County development strategies act as multilevel governance instruments also. In principle these strategies should give an input to national level sectorial development strategies/action plans and the state budget strategy. Nevertheless, in practice this coordination mechanism has remained weak and has had some influence as a soft multi-level cooperation instrument.\n• National cross-sectorial action plans for North-East and South-East regions of Estonia until 2030 to accelerate the development of these two socio-economically less advanced regions. Both documents bring together incentives of different ministries/sectoral policies for development of these regions and include only activities initiated by the central government.\n• As a new initiative, the Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture is piloting regional development agreements/’deals’ in parallel with setting up regional councils mandated for coordination of their further elaboration and implementation, starting with the pilot areas of Central- and South-Estonia. The regional agreements will be anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in region larger than a county.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nTerritorial development trends are being regularly observed within the monitoring framework of the national Regional Development Action Plan. There are around 15-20 indicators to monitor regional disparities in major regional policy challenges/root problems. These indicators have been set in accordance with the strategic objectives of the „Estonia 2035“ strategy and their monitoring indicators at national level. Thereby monitoring the implementation of the Regional Development Action Plan simultaneously enables to assess also how the goals of the national development strategy are reached in territorial dimension.\nMonitoring dashboard minuomavalitsus.ee (https://minuomavalitsus.fin.ee/en). The aim is observe the quality and satisfaction with local governments’ services all over Estonia. The dashboard analyses and visualises hundreds of criteria of the state of local governments’ services. It enables to get an overview of the state of services and development possibilities in each local government, compare local governments’ service levels which contributes to sharing experiences, raise public awareness of the organisation of local services and increase citizens’ informed involvement in discussing local development priorities and needs.\nOther need-based assessments having territorial relevance, like e.g interim and ex-post assessments of the impacts of EU structural funds, the achievement of EU Cohesion Policy goals, or certain governance area or case-specific monitoring exercises (state audit reports, etc).\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\n• Strengthening coordination of regional policy objectives and impacts to regional development across national sectorial policies - like e.g by developing/implementing new cross-sectorial Regional Development Action Plan; guidelines for sectorial ministries to strengthen the positive impacts of new financial support measures to balanced territorial development; facilitating territorial impacts assessment of sectorial policy strategies and regulations).\n• Facilitating multilevel governance and sectorial coordination at regional level larger than counties - by piloting regional development agreements/’deals’ and setting up regional councils mandated for coordination of their further elaboration and implementation.\n• Promoting financial capacity and autonomy of local municipalities and reducing the political and fiscal dependency from the central government.\n• Increasing the role of local governments and their responsibilities in the development of the business environment.\n• A shift towards more flexible and efficient allocation of regional development grant schemes, also by decreasing their fragmentation. A number of smaller and thematically more narrow grant schemes are being combined and applied more flexibly according to priorities of counties’ and other territorial strategies."

Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 57%, 38 percentage points less than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap widened again. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe number of national-level strategic policy documents was reduced and there is no regional policy strategy in place since 2021. Instead, a Regional Development Action Plan (RDAP) was prepared and identifies the most eminent regional socio-economic inequalities which are considered major challenges/ of regional development in Estonia and sets a 4-year action plan covering different sectoral policy activities to address these challenges and support more balanced regional development in the country. Furthermore, the goals of regional balance in the country's strategic development goals are set in the strategy \"Estonia 2035\" (approved in 2021), which is also further addressed by the country's sectoral development plans. Estonia recently started preparing a new national spatial plan, which is scheduled to be finalised by 2026, replacing the current national spatial plan “Estonia 2030”. New regional development support measures have been prepared for the EU Cohesion Policy funds in 2021-27 (around 220 million of euros in total). These measures aim to support balanced territorial development and competitiveness in regions and cities. New specific support measures have also been launched in recent years for regions with the biggest development challenges under the Ida-Virumaa and South-East Estonia programs. A special territorial transition plan for North-Eastern Estonia was endorsed by the European Commission in 2022 and plans for various grant schemes and other support activities to promote the economic and labour market restructuring (around 80% of funding) and social and living environment transition processes (around 20% of funding) in this area. The plan will be funded by the EU Just Transition Fund (340 million euros), i.e., around 2500 euros per inhabitant. North-Eastern Estonia is an area of oil-shale energy production and other carbon-intensive industries that has contributed to the largest share of Estonian carbon emissions and is thereby also most remarkably influenced by decarbonisation processes and transition towards green and carbon-neutral economy and energy production. The national Government has assigned sectorial ministries to take the regional development challenges and impacts into account when designing foreign aid support measures funded by the EU funds of 2021-2027 and to plan concrete solutions to strengthen their compliance with the balanced territorial development target and a special guideline was prepared to support this process. To strengthen the fiscal capacity of local governments, the income tax allocated to local governments was increased by 0.3% (about 34 million euros more in each financial year in 2021 prices) and the equalisation fund added another 25 million euros. In total, the revenue of local governments from the income tax and equalisation fund increased by 4.2% in 2021. The national government supported local governments in times of crises. During the COVID-19 crisis (2020-21), local governments received 176 million euros of additional dedicated support. In 2022, 2.5 million euros were allocated to local governments for providing emergency assistance to the Ukrainian war refugees and about 80 million for the provision of services. In 2022, Estonia launched regional development agreements/’deals’ for the pilot areas of Central- and South-Easter Estonia in parallel with setting up regional councils mandated to coordinate their elaboration and implementation. The regional agreements are anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in regions larger than a county.    In Estonia there is one tier of local governance system. Counties are not municipal administrative units as such, but territories where local governments jointly plan and implement development activities of broader regional importance and manage some public services (public transport for instance).↩︎  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The state concluded ecosystem agreements with 16 urban areas to strengthen innovation activities. The objective of the agreements is to build innovation ecosystems, in other words, to intensify cooperation within networks, strengthen key competences and increase effectiveness of R&D&I activities. The ecosystem agreements were signed in February 2021. Implementation of the agreements will take place with the resources for sustainable urban development in the EU programming period 2021–2027. The effectiveness of regional development is strengthened through cooperation between regions. The state supports regional cooperation by financing regional development theme networks and development zones in 2021-2023. The economic effects of Russia´s war of aggression against Ukraine have been significant in Finland and especially in eastern parts of the country. During the summer of 2022, a working group of State Secretaries worked out measures to strengthen the vitality of eastern Finland. One of the recommendations was that a common development vision must be created for eastern Finland in close cooperation between companies, the state, and the regions. The vision will be published in February 2023. In 2022, a funding tool for supporting R&D&I activities in regions was introduced. The aim is to support R&D activities of companies in different parts of Finland and strengthen the regional innovation policy. Responsibility for organising social and health services and rescue operations was transferred from municipalities and municipal associations to 21 self-governing well-being services counties on the 1 January 2023. The objective of the reform, that created a new administrative level, was to improve the availability and quality of basic public services throughout Finland.

In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

New Caledonia is a sui generis overseas collectivity because of its greater autonomy. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF), which have no permanent population, are also a sui generis collectivity. The COMs are not part of the European Union, with the exception of Saint-Martin which, like the 5 DROMs, is an ultra-peripheral region (RUP). As Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), along with New Caledonia and the TAAFs, the COMs benefit from an \"association regime\", meaning that they are eligible for European development funds while not being subject to Community law.\n\n\nIntermediate-level governments \n101 departments\n\n\nMunicipal-level governments \n34,955 municipalities\n\n\nShare of subnational government in total expenditure/revenues (2021)\n19.0% of total expenditure\n21.3% of total revenues\n[Source: Subnational governments in OECD countries: key data, 2023 edition]\n\n\nKey regional development challenges\nIn its current form, the national policy on regional development has been defined by a partnership agreement between the State and the Regions signed in 2020, which identifies three main issues:\n\nBoosting the companies hardest hit by the crisis;\nGreater regional resilience;\nA genuine ecological and energy transition for a low-carbon economy\n\nThese challenges are considered in European cohesion policy for both the 2014-2020 (notably via REACT EU credits) and 2021-2027 programming periods.\nIn addition, the eleven thematic objectives of cohesion policy for the 2014-2020 period have been replaced by five strategic objectives (SO), in line with the themes supported in 2014-2020, with a stronger focus on territorial development:\n\na more competitive and intelligent Europe by encouraging smart, innovative economic transformation and regional ICT connectivity;\na greener, more resilient and low-carbon Europe moving towards a carbon-free economy, by promoting a clean and equitable energy transition, green and blue investments, the circular economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, risk prevention and management, and sustainable urban mobility;\na more connected Europe through improved mobility;\na more social and inclusive Europe implementing the European social rights base;\na Europe closer to its citizens, by promoting the sustainable and integrated development of all types of territory and local initiatives.\n\nThe principle of concentrating funding on a few themes has also been retained, with the first two Strategic Objectives specifically targeted for the European Regional development Fund ( ERDF). The degree of financial concentration varies according to the category of regions assisted, with the more developed regions having to allocate up to 85% or more of their ERDF resources to these two Specific Objectives.\nOther financial concentration targets have also been set for the ERDF:\n\nAt least 8% of ERDF resources allocated at national level must be allocated to sustainable urban development;\nAt least 30% of the total ERDF budget must contribute to climate protection objectives;\n7.5% of annual expenditure under the multiannual financial framework must contribute to biodiversity objectives in 2024, and 10% in 2026 and 2027. While no quantified target has been set for ERDF funding, programs are expected to contribute to this objective.\n\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nFour major objectives have been jointly defined through the joint mobilization of the State and the regions to :\n1. Revitalizing the economic sectors most affected by the consequences of the Covid crisis, through coordination between national cross-sectoral emergency measures and regional strategies.\n2. Strategic priorities within the framework of State-Region Plan Contracts (CPER) and stimulus packages to build \"the world after\":\n\nEcological transitions (decarbonization of the economy, energy renovation of public buildings, strengthening economic sovereignty and amplifying the momentum in favor of the circular economy, strengthening the resilience and food sovereignty of territories, protecting and investing in biodiversity, anticipating and creating the conditions for territories to adapt to future crises, whether climatic, health or social, for example; accelerating the sustainable transition of the tourism offering).\nResearch, innovation and education (in the fields of campus renovation and the development of high-quality student social housing; digital transition; healthcare; the creation of innovation ecosystems)\nSocial and territorial cohesion (through the reduction of territorial inequalities, the strengthening of small and medium-sized centralities and the revitalization of town centers, accessibility to local services, culture and healthcare; the promotion of clean, soft mobility; the development of digital uses and the fight against illiteracy; the development of cooperation between territories; the fight against land artificialisation and the development of sustainable urban planning).\n\n\nReducing social and territorial inequalities in access to healthcare\nGlobal economic recovery (boosting competitiveness and attractiveness while consolidating companies' financial position; investing in cutting-edge technologies, strengthening resilience and economic sovereignty; accelerating environmental transition and decarbonization of the economy; assisting the most vulnerable and supporting professional transitions; strengthening companies' equity capital; resilience of supply and value chains).\nStrengthening sustainable, resilient and diversified agriculture and territorial food programs\nRenovation and promotion of historical heritage; support for responsible tourism, enabling inclusive growth that respects local people, the region and biodiversity; and for sport, particularly through the Olympic and Paralympic Games as a lever for social and territorial cohesion.\n\n3. A territorialized and differentiated approach to recovery through:\n\nA renewed contractual approach to implement the orientations of the partnership agreement\nBetter coordination between national contractualization and European funds to better support regional projects\nThe implementation of an integrative contractual approach on a sub-regional scale (contracts and programs already existing on this local scale) through ecological recovery and transition contracts (CRTE).\nMobilizing government agencies\nMonitoring and evaluation systems strengthened by the State\n\n4. More resources to build the recovery through:\n\nState and regional commitments to guarantee greater financial capacity for investment\nImmediate support to boost the economy and business activity\nMobilizing European funds as part of regional stimulus packages.\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\n\nArticle 1 of the Constitution states that the French Republic is organized on a decentralized basis.\nThe law of March 2 1982 on the rights and freedoms of communes, départements and regions, which created the regions as fully-fledged territorial authorities and granted them a general competence clause.\nThe law of January 16, 2015 relating to the delimitation of regions, regional and departmental elections and modifying the electoral calendar, which reduced the number of metropolitan regions from 22 to 131.\nThe law of August 7, 2015 on the new territorial organization of the Republic (NOTRe), which redefined the powers assigned to each territorial authority\n\nThe law of May 21, 2021 on the protection of regional languages and their promotion, which recognizes the cultural value of regional languages and provides them with support measures in the fields of heritage, education and public services.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe annual Finance Act governs the vertical equalization mechanism, which applies to all local authorities and is set each year. Transfers to local governments through the general operating grant (DGF) and other transfers were reduced between 2014 and 2018 in line with fiscal consolidation policies. In return, equalization grants have been strengthened to support the weakest sub-national governments.\nThere are several other equalization mechanisms (vertical and horizontal) in France. (i) Vertical equalization mechanisms include the urban solidarity grant and the rural solidarity grant. (ii) Horizontal mechanisms include the départements' equalization funds (one based on transfer duties and the other on Company value-added tax - CVAE) and the Equalization fund for intercommunal and municipal resources (Fonds de péréquation des ressources intercommunales et communales - FPIC). The replacement of the CVAE by a share of VAT (Value added tax) for the regions from 2021 is accompanied by a new regional equalization fund based on VAT. The Finance Bill 2022 also reforms the financial indicators on which the distribution of endowments and equalization funds is based, in order to better assess the wealth of territories (i.e. fiscal and financial potential, tax effort, tax integration coefficient).\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nState-Region partnership agreement of September 28, 2020\nFrench partnership agreement on the strategic guidelines and implementation of the 2021-2027 ERDF, ESF+, JTF (just transition fund) and EMFAF (European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund) programming adopted by the European Commission on June 2, 2022.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\n\nCity policy and city contracts (National Agency for the territorial cohesion – ANCT)\nSmall towns of tomorrow towns (ANCT)\nAction cœur de ville (medium-sized towns) (ANCT)\nEnergy recovery and transition contract (ANCT)\n\n\n\nRural policy framework\nNational Rural Agenda is steered by the ANCT. Since September 2019, numerous measures have been implemented:\n\nsupport for small railroad lines ;\nrecruitment of salaried doctors in under-serviced areas, particularly in rural areas;\nset up 200 micro-folies, third-party cultural venues ;\nroll-out of “Boussole des jeunes”, an online information platform for young people on mobility, career guidance, training, etc.\n\nThe ANCT itself implements a number of measures, notably in favor of trade, third-party sites, youth mobility and the educational success of rural pupils. It also supports local authorities in their contractual and cooperative projects with other territories.\nAt national level, the Agency is monitoring the current first generation of rurality contracts (2016-2020), in conjunction with the program's partners. Territorial delegates support local authorities in drawing up their territorial project and structuring the rurality contract.\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nNational policy concerning the regions is essentially implemented through the State-Region Plan Contracts (see below).\nCohesion funds support regional development strategies. For the 2021-2027 programming period:\nThe total ERDF, ESF+ (European social fund +) and JTF envelope for France amounts to 16.8 billion euros for the period 2021-2027. To this must be added 1.1 billion euros for Interreg cooperation programs managed by French authorities.\nThus, despite a significant reduction in the overall cohesion budget, the allocation for France shows an overall increase of more than 8% compared to 2014-2020. This dynamic is driven in particular by the regional JTF strand and by an increase in ERDF envelopes.\nESF+ credits, on the other hand, show a very slight decrease, even when the national JFT component is included, compared with the ESF, EYE (European Youth Event) and EAFRD (European agricultural fund for rural development) 2014-2020 amounts.\nThese endowments were made to national and regional management authorities on the basis of population size and regional wealth, with a view to showing solidarity with France's least developed regions (the outermost regions – regions ultrapériphériques RUPs).\nEarmarked resources are granted to three different categories of regions:\n\nMore developed regions, with per capita GDP above 90% of the EU average;\nTransition regions, whose per capita GDP is between 75% and 90% of the EU average;\nLess developed regions, whose per capita GDP is less than 75% of the EU average.\n\nLess developed regions will benefit from co-financing rates of up to 85% of project costs. Co-financing rates for transitional and more developed regions will be 60% and 40% respectively.\nIncluding this co-financing, a total of 30 billion euros of investment in eligible expenditure is planned over the 2014-2020 period, or more than 4 billion per year. A potentially even greater leverage effect is anticipated, considering the multiplier effect of financial instruments.\nThese amounts (EU) represent around 250 euros per inhabitant at national level, or almost 450 euros in total cost (including co-financing ). The difference in distribution between the inhabitants of the outermost regions and those of the hexagonal regions is significant, since the amounts (EU) represent an average of around 1,810 euros per inhabitant of the outermost regions, compared with around 156 euros per inhabitant of the hexagonal regions.\nWithin the national framework, regional councils must draw up:\n- SRADDET (Schéma régional d'aménagement, de développement durable et d'égalité des territoires) is a regional planning document that sets out the region's strategy, objectives and rules in a number of areas, such as regional balance and equality, the location of various infrastructures of regional interest, the opening-up of rural areas, housing, the economic management of space, inter-modality and the development of transport, energy management and development, the fight against climate change, air, the protection and restoration of biodiversity, waste prevention and management, etc.\n- The regional scheme for economic development, innovation and internationalization (SRDEII), which sets out guidelines for business aid, support for internationalization, real estate investment aid, innovation aid and guidelines for the attractiveness of the regional territory.\n- The regional plan for higher education, research and innovation (SRESRI) is a document that defines the strategic orientations for higher education, research and innovation for a period of five to ten years.\nThese strategic documents are drawn up by regional councils in consultation with other local authorities, socio-economic players and European partners. They are subject to an environmental assessment and a public inquiry before final adoption.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\nState-Region Plan Contracts (CPER) and State-Region Inter-Regional Plan Contracts (CPIER) define the actions that the State and each of the regional councils undertake to carry out and finance jointly - over a period of six to seven years - to promote regional planning and development.\nSince January 1er 2020, the Directorate General for Local Authorities (DGCL) has been responsible for the inter-ministerial and regional management of these contracts.\nThese were negotiated between the French government, represented by the regional prefect, and each regional council.\nAlmost all the 2021-2027 CPERs and CPIERs were signed in 2022 or early 2023.\nAs part of its role as national coordinator of the CPERs and CPIERs, the DGCL coordinates and coordinates the departments involved in implementing the contracts, both at national inter-ministerial level and at regional level. The DGCL reports annually to Parliament and the “Cour des Comptes” on the qualitative and quantitative implementation of CPERs and CPIERs.\nThe creation of the ANCT by law reflects the central government's action to support sub-national governments in promoting their projects while taking account of current challenges (e.g. cohesion, digital, ecological and demographic transition). ANCT facilitates access by sub-national governments to the resources they need to carry out their projects, notably by providing them with engineering resources (studies, forward-looking workshops, training, co-financing of prime contractors, etc.). It also implements programs to strengthen territorial cohesion by directing public investment towards small and medium-sized towns, disadvantaged areas, the development of the circular economy, industrial renewal (particularly in rural areas) and local public services. ANCT is also heavily involved in the digitization of territories, setting up dedicated infrastructures and supporting various uses (from the fight against illiteracy to the development of new technologies).\nAs the coordinating authority for European funds, ANCT has a \"European Cohesion Centre\", whose main role is to monitor and coordinate the authorities responsible for managing the funds. In addition, two other bodies monitor the use of European funds: (i) the State-Region \"interfund\" committee, co-chaired by the Prime Minister and the President of Régions de France, which coordinates the actions of the various players involved in fund management and control; (ii) the National partnership consultation body (Instance nationale de concertation partenariale -INCOPAP), which reports to the national partnership on fund implementation. This body, co-chaired by ANCT and Régions de France, brings together around 100 representatives of central government (including the fund management and coordination authorities), local authorities, social partners and civil society players. INCOPAP meets as often as necessary, in particular to draw up the strategic and progress reports requested by the European Commission. It monitors the implementation of the funds in France and responds to questions and requests from the national partnership concerning the implementation of the funds.\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nMost local authority investment is carried out within the framework of contractual agreements involving all levels of government, known as State-Region Plan Contracts (CPER), which cover seven-year cycles. These contracts are a tool between the State and the regions, enabling funds to be channelled towards projects that will promote regional development and territorial equality, and reinforce the coherence of public policies at regional level. There are also State-Region Interregional Plan Contracts (CPIER), designed to finance projects with a leverage effect on local investment, and to ensure the implementation of public policies beyond regional borders. The projects covered by these contracts are based on themes defined by the regional prefect and the regional council. CPERs and CPIERs are drawn up using a bottom-up approach, based on local needs and expectations. As a result, the content of each contract differs according to regional issues. In addition, the 7e generation of CP(I)ER, covering the period 2021-2027, extends the scope of contractualisation to new themes (such as gender equality or maritime issues).\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nAt both regional and departmental level, France has maintained a strong administration headed by prefects, as well as local branches of various ministries placed under their authority, known as \"deconcentrated services\". According to the Constitution, the prefect is the direct representative of the Prime Minister and of each minister at regional and departmental level. The Prefect plans and implements government policies. He is responsible for national interests, administrative control, law enforcement and public order.\nThe regional prefects are signatories to the CPERs, responsible for negotiating them with the region and monitoring them from the government's point of view.\nPrefects are also the local representatives of the ANCT.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nThe government pays particular attention to the monitoring and evaluation of contractual arrangements between the State and local authorities, in order to ensure both the efficient execution of State appropriations and their real impact on local areas. Within this framework, the DGCL produces instructions for prefects and ministries, aimed at providing a framework for the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of CP(I)ERs.\nAs part of the process of drawing up the CP(I)ER 2021-2027, particular attention is being paid to their environmental assessment.\nIn addition, the DGCL is implementing an information system for steering and monitoring CPER and CPIER contracts, called “Contrats-Territoires”. This tool will be open to all departments involved in these contracts.\nThe ANCT provides a territorial observatory which, among other things, enables you to monitor the deployment of territorial challenges.\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy"

The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.004 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value.

Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.992. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.195 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.26.

Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 15%, 2 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nStrengthened territorial approaches within European regional programs On average, regional managing authorities plan to allocate over 9% of their ERDF funding to SO5 (a Europe closer to its citizens), with significant variations between programs (from 0% to 23%). All operations financed under this strategic objective will benefit integrated local/territorial development. More than half of the regions plan to rely on integrated territorial investments (ITI) or local development led by local players (in New Aquitaine and French Guiana only). The other authorities will be relying on pre-existing integrated territorial strategies, in particular territorial contracts concluded by the Regions, and more marginally on ecological recovery and transition contracts concluded with the State or city contracts. In terms of integrated urban development, the target areas vary from region to region. While large cities and metropolises remain the main urban areas concerned in most regional programs, others choose to target more restricted areas: priority districts identified by the Urban Policy or city centers. ERDF investment in integrated urban development amounts to over 1.1 billion euros over the period, i.e. more than 12.5% of the ERDF budget, most of which is allocated via OS5 or OS2. This average masks major differences between regions, ranging from 7% to over 30% for the most urbanized regions or those that have opted for strategic targeting of urban areas. This amount is up on 2014-2020, with around 897 million euros of ERDF initially allocated to urban development, or just over 10% (+62 million euros of ESF). In line with the 2014-2020 programming, regional programs will be heavily involved in the themes of a greener Europe, with a forecast 40% of ERDF credits dedicated to urban development. Regional programs will support urban areas in meeting the challenges of ecological transition, attractiveness and revitalization, and the reduction of territorial disparities (including mobility, health and public services). While all regions plan to support integrated territorial development in urban areas, more than half (12 programs) also plan to support territorial development initiatives in rural areas, which will need to be coordinated with the EAFRD and LEADER (\"Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l'Économie Rurale\", meaning 'Links between the rural economy and development actions”) in particular. In total, almost 371 million euros of ERDF funding are earmarked for rural areas, and allocated to a variety of themes. Most regions plan to mobilize OS5.2 to target support for integrated territorial strategies in rural areas, on themes such as health, tourism, territorial attractiveness or biodiversity. Several managing authorities are also planning to support the development of rural areas through other SOs via dedicated territorial approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nReform of the Joint Federal/Länder Task for the Improvement of Regional Economic Structures (GRW): The Joint Federal/Länder Task for the Improvement of Regional Economic Structures (GRW) serves as the backbone of regional structural policy in Germany and addresses structurally weak regions. The Joint Task offers a broad range of funding instruments for private and public investment and strategies that regions can use to meet their specific needs. It is based on the cooperation between the Federation and the Länder anchored in the German Constitution and was established more than five decades ago. In view of changed global and local challenges, the Federation and the Länder have adopted a major reform of the Coordination Framework of the Joint Task which serves as the basis for the respective Länder funding guidelines on 13 December 2022. Throughout the entire process, the expertise of representatives from academia and from companies, associations, trade unions, municipalities and other interested organisations was taken on board. The scope of the reform is large. Main changes include an extension of the objectives of the programme: So far, the focus was on securing and creating jobs. Now, three main objectives are pursued: (1) creating and safeguarding jobs, boosting growth and prosperity; (2) offsetting disadvantages affecting commercial activity; (3) accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral and sustainable economy. In line with this, the reform enables better support for green investments both in terms of eligible projects and funding intensity. Also, the reform leads to a better recognition of local value chains: It is not decisive any longer, whether firms operate primarily locally or transregionally; instead, investment projects are eligible for funding, if they make a significant contribution to attaining the programme objectives. Another major change is the introduction of support for regional services of general interest in order to strengthen regional attractiveness for firms and employees. With respect to infrastructure investments, more effort is placed on regional development concepts in order to stimulate an integrated regional development. Following on the reform of the Joint Task, the federal government will continue to further develop regional policy in Germany. EU structural funds: The German Partnership Agreement and the programmes for the EU structural funds for the funding period 2021-2027 have been adopted in 2022 and implementation gathers pace. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is focused on innovation, digitization and economic transformation (56% of the budget). Investments target the competitiveness of SME, knowledge and technology transfer and the improvement of public and private research infrastructure. In comparison to the last funding period the importance of climate and environmental goals in the ERDF further increased (34% of the funding). Investments target energy efficient production processes and renovation of public buildings, adaptation to climate change, risk management and disaster prevention including nature-based solutions. The new Just Transition Fund supports coal regions in four German federal states with additional means to master structural change. The investments of the European Social Fund Plus target skill development and social inclusion. Structural Strengthening Act: The Structural Strengthening Act has been introduced in 2020 to provide financial support to the regions most affected by the coal phase-out. Until the end of 2022 the federal government has approved projects of the Länder totaling 6.4 bn EUR. The majority of funds are allocated to projects related to improving locations for businesses, research and development as well as education. The Bund-Länder Coordination Body has approved 107 projects of the federal government totaling up to 19.5 bn EUR. This includes R&D projects and institutions, transport infrastructure and the relocation of federal agencies (4415 full time-equivalents have been planned so far). The first evaluation of the Structural Strengthening Act is ongoing and will be published in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Regional inequality trends\nHungary experienced a decline in the Theil index of GDP per capita over 2000-2020. Inequality reached its maximum in 2007. The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2001 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.04 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.052 higher in the same period, indicating bottom convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 2.026. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.112 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.237. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.03 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.274 in 2020 and increased by 0.095 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Hungary, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity decreased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 35%, 4 percentage points less than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to narrow. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Hungary, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions while the opposite was true for the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022)."

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\n\nSince 2022, territorial development has gained prominence in the policy agenda, and accordingly, its tasks and powers evolved. As of May 2022, the Minister for Regional Development is a member of the government with unified development policy responsibilities. In order to prepare for the EU Cohesion Policy programming period 2021-2027, the objectives of the National Development and Territorial Development Concept (NDTDC) and the national development priorities for the period post-2020 have been revised as well as the related sectoral and territorial development tasks. The ambition is to renew the regional development approach and planning environment in order to start the 2028-2034 EU budget period in a new planning and development ecosystem that can respond more quickly and efficiently to challenges and with a more explicit territorial approach. It is necessary to rethink the territorial objectives of the NDTDC, the development challenges of the country, and make the system of tools and institutions for territorial development suitable and resilient to manage new challenges. As part of the preparation for the next programming period and in compliance with the plan renewal obligations laid down in the relevant legislation, the review of the territorial development concepts of the counties, the special functional areas and of the capital, and the elaboration of the related territorial development programmes were completed during 2020-2021. The planning documents were adopted by the county and capital assemblies. Following negotiations with the European Commission and a social consultation, Hungary officially submitted the Partnership Agreement to the European Commission on 30 December 2021, which was adopted by the Commission in December 2022, together with the operational programmes. The Partnership Agreement lays down the developments on which the country will spend the cohesion funds coming to Hungary from the EU's multiannual financial framework (21.7 billion euros). The focus will continue to be on economic development, competitiveness, infrastructure development and job creation. Another essential element of this strategic document is that it states that, in order to facilitate catch-up, at least 65 percent of the resources must be used in the four most disadvantaged Hungarian regions. A territorial operational program was prepared for the period 2021-2027, “Territorial and Settlement Development Operational Programme Plus” (TOP Plus). TOP Plus manages both place-based developments of the less-developed regions and Budapest being a developed region, using ERDF and ESF+ funds. The TOP Plus continues the 2014-2020 TOP themes and its model realised through integrated territorial programmes with a budget of €4.3 billion. It maintains the themes and tools of supporting local government developments, integrated county planning, the territorial selection procedure, and the active involvement of regional actors (county level local governments and the capital city local government) in planning and implementation. TOP Plus was adopted in December 2022. The planning of the county and capital integrated territorial programmes (ITPs) took place in parallel to TOP Plus programming, based on the principles and budget framework of TOP Plus, and with the guidelines of the relevant sectoral ministries. This parallel planning method created the territorial legitimacy of TOP Plus. The preliminary ITPs were adopted by the Government in 2022, and their content will be finalised in the first semester of 2023. A sustainable urban development strategy (SUD) is being prepared in 42 cities (among them 3 functional urban areas) selected in the county integrated territorial programmes and they are allocated 8% of the national ERDF framework and related ESF+ funds. The SUD has a complex approach and is in line with the city's integrated settlement development strategy. The indicative budget for the cities designated in the framework of the sustainable urban development tool is set in the 1658/2021. (IX. 24.) Government decision. The action plan developed by SUD for TOP+ resources is the TOP+ Urban Development Program Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe Strategic Regional Plan (SRP) of Iceland 2022-2036 is an integrated social and economic development plan that provides a framework for regional support. Its main goals are to address depopulation in individual regions; address the lack of economic and industrial diversity; support technological changes and the development and adaption of individual industries; outline necessary adaption measures to counter the impacts of climate change; ensure smooth communications and access to services and respond to increasing competition for people and companies. The following points are examples of challenges and opportunities that are addressed in a novel or more decisive way than in previous SRP’s  Existing knowledge on the effects of climate change, risk assessments and impacts on biological diversity are to be considered in all policy making, planning and decisions concerning the development of communities, land use and planning on land, sea and in coastal areas. In this regard a special action in the SRP has the objective … “to formulate a comprehensive approach to the adaptation of municipalities to the effects impacts of climate change.” This is in line with the emphasis of the Nordic Council of Ministers Following a steep increase in number of immigrants an emphasis is on facilitating social diversity and demographic factors, such as gender, age and origin and the opportunities inherent in the human resources of each rural community are to be fully utilised. In that regard a special action will be implemented with the objective to increase awareness of the importance of equality and diversity within local governments by supporting their efforts to reflect the diversity of human society so that their decision making serves the needs and benefits the entire population while being in compliance with their gender equality plans. In effort to boost the international competitiveness of the country for investments and human capital along with equalizing the access to jobs and services for the whole population a special focus is on the urban – rural linkage. For that purpose, a designated action is on the SRP with the aim to define the role of the two largest urban areas in the overall regional development of the country. The work will be executed in the OECD NUP framework as applicable. The contemporary digital revolution has already weakened the ties between subsistence and residence in many occupations and that opens opportunities for more freedom of residence which is the aim of one the 44 actions of the SRP by increasing the number of location independent jobs to increase the variety of jobs in rural areas. The prospects of communities may thus increasingly be determined by factors such as natural amenities, spatial planning, the provision of services to children and the elderly, cultural and recreational opportunities, and beyond anything else a good and enjoyable social life.

The URDF fund has an overall provision of €2 billion to support projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland’s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and NDP and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) adopted by each of the three Regional Assemblies.\nRecent URDF Funding allocations, by Region, are outlined as follows:\n\n\n\nRegional Authority Area\nNumber of Projects\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nEastern and Midlands Region**\n56\nc. €638 million\n\n\nSouthern Region*\n46\nc. €787 million\n\n\nNorthern and Western Region*\n30\nc. €212 million\n\n\n\n*Figures from August 2022 ; **Figures from June 2023\nA full list of all NDP funded programs, by region, and including funding amounts, is available on the NDP Tracker:\nhttps://www.gov.ie/en/collection/f828b-myprojectireland-interactive-map/\nRegional assemblies also manage certain EU funding programmes like the European Regional Development Fund. Funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is also targeted at balanced regional development, with percentage dividends distributed in line with regional need i.e. ‘more developed’ regions, the Southern and the Eastern & Midlands regions will receive 40% in EU financing, while as a ‘transition’ region the North-Western region will receive 55% in EU financing.\nIn addition to the above, investment for the development of rural Ireland is available through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. (Further details of funding provision is contained within the ‘Rural policy framework’ section of this report).\n\n\nKey regional development challenges\nOn a regional and national level, it is well documented that Ireland has faced particular challenges in terms of housing delivery over recent years. Several Government initiatives are addressing this issue and pursuant to the aims and objectives included within the overarching Government strategy ‘Housing for All’, there are plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 units per year over the next decade. This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4bn per annum, through an overall combination of €12bn in direct Exchequer funding, €3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.\nPublication of new dwelling completion figures, released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), on a national basis, shows the following trends on housing delivery up to Q4 2022.\nNew dwelling completions for 2022 totalled 29,822, an increase of 45.1% on 2021, when 20,553 dwellings were completed.\nIn 2022, 84.1% of all new dwelling completions were in urban areas and the remainder in rural areas. At the beginning of the series in 2011, 38% were in urban and 62% in rural areas.\nFurthermore, the Irish Government is continually responding to a changing policy context as it relates to national, regional and local planning policy, with specific consideration to be given to climate transition requirements – addressing sectoral emission targets and the Climate Action Plan 2023; changing and diverse demographics, particularly during periods of uncertainty (war in Ukraine) and the impacts of digitalisation on work, retail, commuting and regional development.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nAs previously outlined, Regional Policy Objectives for each of the three individual regions are contained within the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES’s) and align to National policy objectives contained with the NPF and NDP; and are implemented through the Project Ireland 2040 (PI2040) Delivery Board with the support of the Regional Assemblies. Metropolitan area strategic plans (MASP’s) for each of the five city-regions in Ireland, including Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are also contained within the relevant RSES.\nKey ‘Regional Policy Objectives’ relate to the 10 identified ‘National Strategic Outcomes’ of the NPF, which include a focus upon:\n\nCompact Growth\nEnhanced Regional Accessibility\nStrengthening Rural Economies and Communities\nSustainable Mobility\nA Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills\nHigh-Quality International Connectivity\nEnhanced Amenity and Heritage\nTransition to Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society\nSustainable Management of Water, Waste and other Environmental Resources\nAccess to Quality Childcare, Education and Health Services\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nLegal Framework\nPlanning legislation (Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended) recognises the importance of the RSES in establishing a regional roadmap for the strategic delivery of sustainable development of urban and rural areas to secure balanced regional development and co-ordination of plans at regional and local level. The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, (the Act), provides the legislative framework for the enactment of the RSES’s.\nPursuant to Section 21 of the Act, a Regional Assembly may make a Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy:\n\nafter consultation with the planning authorities within its region, or\nin the case of the regional assemblies in respect of the GDA, after consultation with the planning authorities within their regions and the NTA, or\nshall make a regional spatial and economic strategy, at the direction of the Minister.\n\nLegislative requirements regarding consultation, procedure, monitoring and review of the RSES’s are contained within Section 22 to 27D of the Act, as well as requirements for local planning policy to be consistent with the objectives contained within each individual RSES.\nInstitutional Framework\n\nMember’s Associations: The members of the Regional Assemblies are nominated from the elected members of the local authorities in the region. The national association with the role of protecting and promoting the interests of the regional assembly members is the Association of Irish Regions (AIR). For locally elected members of local government in Ireland the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG) also serves this function. The AILG explicitly represent the elected members as there is a separate association for the chief executives – the County and City Management Association (CCMA).\nState Bodies: A number of State bodies, under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage support the objectives of the RSES, including monitoring and review, an outline of which is set out below.\nLand Development Agency (LDA): The Land Development Agency (LDA) was established on an interim basis in September 2018 by way of an Establishment Order made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971. The Land Development Agency Act 2021 was enacted in July 2021 and following commencement of relevant provisions, the Land Development Agency Designated Activity Company was incorporated in December 2021. Following the dissolution of the interim entity, the LDA has been established as a commercial state body. The agency assists implementation of RSES objectives by coordinating appropriate State lands for regeneration and development, opening up key sites which are not being used effectively for housing delivery, and driving strategic land supply and assembly for housing.\nAn Bord Pleanála (ABP): Under Section 143 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, An Bord Pleanála is required to have regard to the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy in the performance of its functions. Section 37 of the Act provides that where a planning authority has decided to refuse permission for development on the grounds that a proposed development materially contravenes the development plan, the Board may grant permission where it considers, inter alia, that permission for the proposed development should be granted having regard to the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for the area. Furthermore, under Section 37A, strategic infrastructure developments are dealt with directly by the Board in cases including where the scheduled development would contribute substantially to the fulfilment of any of the objectives in the RSES.\nOffice of the Planning Regulator (OPR): The OPR seeks to secure the objectives of the RSES via the three statutory functions of the Office, namely (a) assessment of statutory plans (b) reviews of local authority planning functions and (c) education, training and research and awareness. The OPR carries out an assessment and evaluation of statutory plans to ensure consistency with national and regional planning policy. These include City and County Development Plans (including Variations) and Local Area Plans (including Alterations).\n\nOPR’s Research, Education, Training and Public Awareness Activity functions: Under Section 31(Q)(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, a core function of the OPR is to conduct education and training programs for elected members and staff of planning authorities and regional assemblies. The OPR training and research program strongly supports the implementation of the Regional Strategic Outcomes (RSO’s) contained within each RSES by upskilling and informing staff, elected representatives and decision makers in local authorities and regional assemblies on the principles, policies and procedures that support the implementation of these policy objectives.\nThe OPR has collaborated with the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG) to develop a tailor-made planning training program for elected members and this included the elected members of the Regional Assemblies. The program currently focuses on topical themes relevant to the members’ role in Making Local Area Plans, Rural transport, Energy and Planning Legislation and Guidance. Furthermore, the OPR, in conjunction with the City and County Managers Association (CCMA), advanced work on the completion of a Learning and Development Strategy for local authority and regional assembly staff. The strategy was finalised in 2022 and issued to the DHLGH, and the chair of the Housing, Building and Land Use Committee of the CCMA. The Learning and Development Strategy was formally published in Q1 of 2023.\n\n\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nA full list of budget allocation for projects approved under the National Development Plan, by region, are accessible to view online within the NDP Projects Tracker, linked herein: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/f828b-myprojectireland-interactive-map/\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nAs previously outlined, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) form part of an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans that are established in legislation, with the National Planning Framework (NPF) at a national level, the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) at regional level, and individual city and county plans and local area plans at county level.\nThe Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy’s for each of the three Regional Assembly areas contain the overarching regional development policy framework and specifically identify local opportunities for balanced regional development as well as enhancement/ protection of natural assets, including built heritage and special areas of conservation.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThe current growth strategy of the NPF seeks to shift the spatial pattern of development in Ireland towards more regionally balanced, city focused and compact growth. The strategy is to target population growth split roughly 50:50 between the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly Area (EMRA) and the rest of the Country i.e. the other two Regional Assembly areas (i.e. Southern Regional Assembly (SRA) area; Northern and Western Regional Assembly (NWRA) area). In addition, to encourage more compact and sustainable development, the NPF also targets half of future housing growth that will take place in the five cities to 2040, to be within the existing built footprint of each city, on a combination of what are termed ‘brownfield’ and ‘infill’ development sites.\nThis growth strategy is supported by national ‘Section 28’ Guidelines and key ‘Regional Policy Objectives’ contained within each RSES. In addition, local policy initiatives outlined hereunder within the ‘major regional policy tools’ section of this report, such as the Vacant Site Levy and the Croí Cónaithe (Towns) and (Cities) Funds, further support the delivery of sustainable development in accordance with this overarching strategy across the regions.\nEvolving Policy - Directly Elected Major\nLegislation is currently being prepared to introduce the function of a directly elected mayor for Limerick City and County Council, following approval to create this level of governance by a citizen majority in a plebiscite. A mayoral function for Greater Dublin is also under consideration following recommendations arising from a Citizens’ Assembly consultation process.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nThe National Planning Framework and RSES supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging their growth and prosperity while also seeking to arrest the decline in areas that have experienced low population growth in recent decades. ‘Our Rural Future – Rural Development Policy 2021-2025’ is the new whole-of-Government policy for the sustainable development of rural Ireland, which was launched on 29 March 2021. It contains more than 150 commitments for delivery across Government over a five-year period.\nAs part of Project Ireland 2040 (PI2040) the government has committed to providing an additional €1 billion over the period 2019 to 2027 for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. This will provide investments to renew towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000 people. Underpinned by this significant NDP funding, the RRDF provides an opportunity to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland, to make a sustainable impact in rural communities, and to address depopulation in small rural towns, villages and rural areas. It will be a key instrument to support the objectives of the NPF and RSES relating to Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities.\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\nAs outlined above, the legislative basis for the adoption of the RSES as part of the national regional development policy framework is contained within the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Delivery of objectives contained within the three individual RSES is supported through funding mechanisms including the URDF, RRDF and the the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); as well as a range of other Government led initiatives at local government level. Recent local government policy initiatives, which support realization of RSES objectives, include, but are not limited to:\nThe Residential Zoned Land Tax is a new tax aimed at increasing housing supply by activating zoned, serviced residential development lands (including mixed-use lands) for housing. It also aims to incentivise landowners to use existing planning permissions for housing. The tax is being introduced as part of Housing for All, the government's housing plan to 2030. The annual tax will apply at a rate of 3% of the land’s market value.\nThe Vacant Site Levy, introduced by the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which empowers local authorities to compile a vacant site register and to apply a levy to properties listed on the vacant site register. The rate increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant properties from 2019. Site owners became liable to pay from 2020.\nThe Croí Cónaithe (Towns) Fund provides a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties in towns and villages, with priority given to areas with high levels of vacancy or dereliction.\nThe Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Fund launched in May 2022 seeks to increase the supply of owner occupier apartments in cities. The scheme is expected to deliver up to 5,000 additional apartments in the five NPF cities. It will support the Government’s objectives of compact growth and creating vibrant liveable cities. The scheme is targeting the activation of existing planning permissions for apartment developments over four-storeys in height that cost more to build than they can be sold for to individual buyers. The Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme will bridge the viability gap for developments that meet the eligibility criteria. The Government has allocated €450 million for the scheme up to 2026.\nNew Policy Framework - Marine Spatial Planning\nKey developments since the adoption of the RSES have been the publication of the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), and the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021. The NMPF was launched in July 2021 and represents the proposed approach to managing Ireland’s marine activities to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources to 2040. This single framework, bringing together all marine-based human activities, and sets out objectives and planning policies for each activity. Those activities include offshore renewable energy; fisheries; ports, harbors and shipping; safety at sea; sport and recreation; tourism; and wastewater treatment and disposal. The NMPF will be the key decision-making tool for Government departments, state agencies, regulatory authorities and policymakers for decisions on marine activities for all regions.\nThe Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 constitutes the biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the State, with a legal and administrative framework to support a marine environment that Ireland can benefit from socially, environmentally and economically. The Act 2021 establishes a new planning regime for the maritime area and will be a key enabler of decarbonisation of Ireland’s energy sources and the development of offshore energy. It streamlines arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle, i.e. one State consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental assessment.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nDelivery of the RSES objectives are the key policy tool available to Regional Assemblies to co-ordinate, promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development; to make local government and public services more effective and to have an agreed funding and delivery programme for capital projects within their own areas of influence. However, interregional collaboration is also recognised as a core component of the workings of each of the Regional Assemblies. It is recognised that complex strategic objectives of the RSES can only be achieved through collaboration with adjoining regions that have similar objectives and priorities. Good governance and leadership from the Regional Assemblies has contributed to the overall sustainability and viability of interregional and cross border initiatives such as the Association of Irish Regions, which is a collaborative platform representing the three Regional Assemblies at both a political and executive level. This association is made up of the current and former Cathaoirligh of each of the three Regional Assemblies, supported by the Directors of each Assembly.\nThe three Regional Assemblies, under the project management of the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly, have established a Regional Data Hub to monitor the performance of the RSES over its lifecycle and provide a wealth of spatial data for multiple stakeholders using free web-based access. Furthermore, a dedicated RSES Network Group has also been established which provides a forum for the executive of the three Regional Assemblies to progress implementation of the RSESs and related policy and research. This is supported by an Assistant Director Forum made up of the Senior Planners of each Regional Assembly. Ongoing formal and informal cooperation between Regional Assemblies is also not always explicitly linked to the RSES, but also encompasses discussions regarding EU Regional Operational Programmes and the Committee of the Regions.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nPursuant to Section 25A of the Planning and Development Act, as amended, in respect of the regional spatial and economic strategy (RSES) of a regional assembly, public bodies and each local authority within the relevant regional assembly area shall, every 2 years, prepare and submit a report to the assembly setting out progress made in supporting objectives, relevant to that body, of the strategy.\nFollowing receipt of the Section 25A progress reports from public bodies and local authorities, each regional assembly shall, every 2 years, prepare a report (in this section referred to as a monitoring report) monitoring progress made in implementing the regional spatial and economic strategy. The monitoring report shall specify the progress made in securing the overall objectives of the regional spatial and economic strategy, including any specific actions and outcomes, including actions specific to the public bodies including:\n\nthe Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage\nthe Minister for Finance,\nthe Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,\nthe Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation,\nthe Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources,\nthe Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine,\nthe Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport,\nthe Minister for Health,\nthe Minister for Education and Skills,\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade\n\nEach Regional Assembly is required to submit its monitoring report to the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC). The National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC), which was introduced with the Local Government Reform Act 2014, has an independent role in providing evaluations and oversights over the local government sector. NOAC’s functions are wide ranging and involve the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically. The National Oversight and Audit Commission shall consider the monitoring report of the Regional Assembly and may make recommendations to the Minister in relation to relevant measures to further support the implementation of the RSES.\nOngoing Engagement as an Evaluation and Monitoring Tool\nIn addition to the legislative requirements outlined above, members of the Regional Assemblies participate in a Plans Evaluation Forum (the Forum), which was established in June 2019 and is facilitated by the Office of the Planning Regulator. The purpose of the Forum is to facilitate discussion and information sharing in the consideration of statutory plans and encourage greater policy alignment between national, regional and local objectives amongst stakeholders in the context of the local plan making process. Forum members meet approximately every four to six weeks. Regional Assembly staff engage proactively with the forward planning teams in the planning authorities within each regional assembly area to discuss the preparation of the county’s pending development plans and local area plans. The alignment of local plans to the RSES is a key focus of these discussions.\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nPreparatory steps are underway to facilitate a First Revision of the National Planning Framework (NPF), as provided for under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) and committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.\nSpecifically, section 20C (5) of the Planning Act states the following:\nEvery 6 years after the date of publication of the National Planning Framework, the Government shall either—\na) revise the Framework or replace it with a new one, or\nb) publish a statement explaining why the Government has decided not to revise the Framework and include in the statement an indication of a date by which it will be revised or a new National Planning Framework will be published.\nThe first revision of the NPF, which will be facilitated by the release of Census 2022 data, will dictate any future changes to regional policy/RSES objectives."

Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 66%, 60 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to widen. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group.

In Ireland, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions, approximately by the same amount. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution.

Their municipal budget is therefore limited.\n• Although regional concepts and management mechanisms do exist to some extent (e.g. Ministry of Interior’s 12 “Regional Clusters”, engaging 64% of Israel’s local municipalities) they are still partial and voluntary, and in most aspects, municipalities are still independently managed.1\n• Lack of a national formal definition to regions: different government levels provide numerous spatial regional maps differentiated by their regional subdivisions. This adds another bureaucratic challenge and prevents potential collaborations between neighboring municipalities.\n• Small municipalities are missing sufficient thresholds to provide quality infrastructure such as waste management treatment plants.\n• Service provision is lacking in small municipalities (e.g. transportation, education, health).\n• Major inequalities between center and peripheral municipalities.\n• Competition between neighboring municipalities (instead of collaboration).\n• Israel’s key transportation mode is based on private car ownership which further challenges regional accessibility, especially in rural areas.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\n• In 2013, the Ministry of Interior established the concept of “Regional Clusters”, with the aim to promote economic development and to support voluntary collaborations between neighboring municipalities across various initiatives (e.g., education, employment opportunities).\n• The Ministry of Interior’s “Regional Clusters” strive to promote the following objectives:\n\nIncrease service provision efficiency (both in terms of costs and service quality)\nImprove services or management tools (including inequality, accessibility, expand or create services)\nRegional management and development of spaces crossing municipal borders\nRegional economic development\nRegional cohesion (by promoting shared activities, shared representation, mutual support)\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\n• The current institutional regional division is administrative but is not used as a tier of governance. It is used to provide and manage some services such as planning. The planning system is comprised of six districts. Each planning district has a Building Committee which is responsible for deliberating and approving plans within the district, in accordance to national policies and plans.\n• The Ministry of Interior’s “Regional Clusters” is a statutory organization initiated by the Minister’s order. Each Cluster is officially known as a unifying body of municipalities and it is legally authorized to initiate, promote, and implement regional cooperations between member municipalities. The clusters act across different areas of interest (including economic, social, environmental, and strategic) with similar authority to the municipalities and according to the cluster’s committee decisions.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\n• In 2022 the Ministry of Interior allocated 57 million NIS to “Regional Clusters”-related activities – a sum that represents a relatively small portion of its budget. However, this amount has increased over the last decade (in comparison to only 2 million NIS in 2013).\n• Designated Geographic Investigation Committees advise the Minister of Interior on issues related to: (1) revenue distribution and (2) boundaries between adjunct municipalities. The Committees serve as professional advisory teams and can issue recommendations regarding land transfers from one municipality to another or re-distribution of revenues to address specific conditions. The Minister can choose whether to adopt the Committees' recommendations.\n• Regional Clusters funding relies on several sources: municipal budget, allocation from the Ministry of Interior and other ministries, philanthropic funds, and self-funding mechanisms.\n• In addition to the clusters, the Spatial Planning and Development team in the Home Affairs, Planning and Development division at the Prime Minister’s office, promotes and manages the implementation of various government resolutions addressing regional development. These government resolutions target specific areas, for examples: Resilience Plans for the \" Gaza Envelope\" region (Government resolution No.566); Encourage sustainable demographic development in the Golan Heights sub district (No. 864); the Development of cities in the Eastern Negev region (No. 1416), the Empowerment and development plan for the Druze and Circassians populations (No. 959); the Development of cities in the north of Israel (No. 3740).These include policy tools from different themes, including infrastructure, education, welfare, housing, tax benefits, planning, waste treatment, climate change preparation and more.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\n• See previous sections for information about the Regional Clusters and Israel's administrative division to districts.\n\n\nUrban policy framework\n• Israel does not have a specific urban policy framework. However, over 90% of Israel's localities are urban and therefore much of its policies address urban conditions. Densification of the urban environment by setting minimum density requirements, urban regeneration and infill development of existing cities, and urban development around mass transit systems are among Israel's urban policy priorities. All of these aim to efficiently utilize the use of land.\n• Another example focuses on utilizing underground spaces in Israel. The Spatial Planning and Development team in the Home Affairs, Planning and Development division at the Prime Minister’s office, promotes and manages the government resolution to support the development and utilization of underground spaces (No. 1736). The government decision forms a cross governmental committee, headed by the Director General of the Prime Minister's office, with a mandate to draft a national plan to promote and implement the utilization of underground spaces. The team's goals are as follows:\n\nCreating economic incentives for construction and development in the underground.\nPromoting planning, registration, and marketing in the underground.\nPromoting research and making knowledge accessible.\nPromoting infrastructure tunnels.\n\n\n\nRural policy framework\nGovernment decision #2262 from April 2022 declared a list of specific regions and settlements as “National Priority Area(s)” in order to strengthen the Country’s economic and social capital. National Priority Areas are municipal regions designated by the government to receive tax cuts, special benefits and funds for housing, education and culture, as well as tax exemptions, special mortgage rates, and other lucrative subsidies.\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\n• The Spatial Planning and Development team in the Home Affairs, Planning and Development division at the Prime Minister’s office in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and the West Negev Regional Cluster, are promoting the development of the “agri-tech” industry in the West Negev area (government resolution No. 566).\n• The Ministry of Interior acts to strengthen local municipalities. It works with other ministries to examine what needs to be accomplished at the regional level via the “Regional Clusters” organization and which challenges they could potentially overcome with support from regional policy tools. The Ministry of Economy and Industry, for example, provides incentives to employers based on the “National Priority Areas(s)” map to target and hire quality workforce.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at national level\n• The Ministry of Interior promotes relevant pilots to examine government decisions with a regional character and to facilitate learning to all parts involved. For example: establishing a plastic recycling regional facility of agriculture waste (West Negev cluster) or creating a regional framework to promote social economic learning and skills toward the 21st century among newborns-job market ages to enable regional social mobility (Beit HaKerem cluster).\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\n• The Ministry of Interior initiates Steering Committees to monitor pilot results (see previous section).\n• The Israel Planning Administration operates across government levels with a clear hierarchical structure. The Planning system is comprised of local, regional, and national planning committees and adjacent planning bureaus at each level.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\nEach region has a planning bureau which adheres and reports to the national level. The planning system is hierarchical, and regional plans are attuned to national plans.\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nThe Ministry of Interior’s pilots (see above) are required to provide assessment benchmarks such as implementation timeframe and scale, future revenues and IRR. Each pilot tailors their own monitoring tools.\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\n• Research on “Redefining spatial planning and development in Israel” is led by the Spatial Planning and Development team in the Home Affairs, Planning and Development division at the Prime Minister’s office (January 2023). The research will include an overview and analysis of Israel's spatial development structure, current needs and future relevant trends, and will provide concrete spatial development policy recommendations. The output will be an official OECD publication, which is expected to respond to the needs of Israeli authorities.\n• Government decision #675 from November 2021: Decentralizing powers to the local government and reducing excess regulation.\n• A joint-departmental committee led by The Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Interior was established based on #675 decision, to (1) map the various responsibilities throughout the government ministries that pertain to the local authorities; (2) hold discussions with local government representative; and to (3) present to the government a roadmap for the implementation of decentralization of powers."

The group was tasked with assessing the structural challenges and dis-efficiencies of the national-local government relationship. The taskforce completed its work in 2020 and submitted its reform proposal. The reform proposed to develop a third level of regional government to bridge between the national and the local. The reform was not adopted by the government; however, the government published resolution #675 (Nov 2021) with the purpose of decentralizing powers to the local government and reducing excess regulation (see more under “Future orientations of regional policy”).    To propose a new “Regional Cluster” the Ministry of Interior specifies the following criteria: The cluster needs to include a minimum of 6 municipalities; The cluster needs to include a minimum of 50,000 residents; The cluster needs to be heterogenic in terms of municipality type and social groups; Geographic sequence between municipalities is required.↩︎  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.044 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.006 higher in the same period, indicating bottom convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value.

Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.324. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.027 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.198. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.012 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.163 in 2020 and decreased by 0.043 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Italy, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity decreased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions declined roughly by 6%, while it declined only by 4% in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap remained unchanged. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Italy, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the industrial sector reduced the labour productivity gap between regions. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions, approximately by the same amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement between the EU Commission and Italy, adopted in July 2022, sets out investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 to promote national cohesion and sustainable development, with a particular focus on the Southern Regions. Around €75 billion of EU funds and national co-financing sustain the green and digital transition, while supporting the most fragile territories and vulnerable groups. To this aim, the Partnership Agreement promotes the implementation of policies that are tailored to the relevant territorial scales and effective multi-level governance to ensure a more even distribution of essential services and economic opportunities. In particular, the Partnership Agreement continues to support the National Strategy for Inner Areas, to make them more resilient to natural risks, developing employment opportunities, improving the quality of services (education, healthcare, mobility), and promoting municipal associations in the territories involved. The National Programme for Metropolitan Cities and Southern medium-sized Cities 2021-2027 addresses the challenges of fighting climate change and socio-economic inequalities, re-generating marginal urban areas and supporting social innovation projects, public housing and the development of digital services. The Just Transition Fund (€1,2 billion of EU and national resources) supports the diversification of the economic activities currently based on carbon intensive industries in the areas of “Sulcis Iglesiente” in Sardinia and Taranto in Apulia. Within Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement, the collaboration between the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Department of Cohesion Policy ensures the production of subnational statistics and indicators at the level of granularity needed to assess the contribution of policies in different places. In recent years, a significant investment has been made to expand the breadth and depth of data and indicators available for regions, cities and rural areas in many domains, including SDGs, well-being, environmental quality, business environment. As concerns the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), one of its key objectives is to promote social and territorial cohesion. Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) allocates 40 per cent of investments with a territorial destination to the Southern Regions (around €82 billion out of a total of €206 billion). In particular, the Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport has allocated 55 per cent of its NRRP and complementary resources (€61,5 billion) to projects in the Southern regions (railway infrastructures, ports and logistics, sustainable urban mobilty, water infrastructures, public housing), in line with the objectives of territorial cohesion and inequality reduction. This threshold represents a relevant ambitious objective: under national public investment programmes, 34 per cent of capital resources are allocated to the South (in proportion to the resident population). In general, the use of the RRF versus Cohesion Policy funds is guided by eligibility, national/regional competences, timing and investment scale. The Italian Government has put a significant investment in human resources within administrations at the centre of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, strengthening the capacities for effective management of public investment particularly at territorial level (including procurement processes, evaluation and project design, management of contracts and project delivery approaches). The Infrastructural Equalisation Fund, “Fondo perequativo infrastrutturale” (€4,6 billion from 2022 to 2033) has the objective of rebalancing the infrastructural divide between different areas, with a particular focus on the Southern Regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.007 lower in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating decreased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.055 higher in the same period, indicating bottom convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 0.736. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.04 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 0.83. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap decreased by 0.092 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was in 2020 and by percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Korea, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2008 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 24%, 3 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to widen. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022)."

When the new law is enacted, the budget of special account for balanced national development will be converted into a special account for balanced regional development, and projects related to comprehensive plans and balanced regional development policies will be promoted. Future orientations include:  Transfer the authority of the central government to local governments for supporting growth engines with a comparative advantage on their own Introduce Opportunity Development Zone (ODZ) to encourage investment in provincial urban areas. Various benefits including tax cuts will be provided to companies relocating to the area Introduce special zones for free education to provide customised public education for each region. If designated as a special zone, administrative and financial support will be given to diversify public education, such as various alternative schools Introduce special urban convergence zones to create a complex that combines industry, housing and culture with the aim of balanced regional development  Further, the Korean government intends to contribute to balanced national development by enacting the \"Special Act on Supporting Depopulation Areas\" to improve settlement conditions in depopulation areas and promote regional vitality. This special law establishes a comprehensive regional development and national-level regional support system for local governments to cope with the population decline crisis, and stipulates ways to promote linkages and cooperation between local governments, and special cases for population reduction areas. The Special Act on Supporting Depopulation Areas has been in effect since January 1, 2023, and is currently pursuing a policy to enhance regional vitality by investing 1 trillion KRW in 89 regions every year for 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.177 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.064 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nThere is no data for the gap in GDP percapita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions for 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.804. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.414 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.804 in 2020 and increased by 0.414 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Lithuania, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity decreased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 89%, 12 percentage points less than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap remained unchanged. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Lithuania, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in regions that used to be located in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution while it went up in regions located in the lower half. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions while the opposite was true for the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors.

Bottom-up approach allows regions (Regional Development Councils) to make decisions, what and to what extent the identified social, economic, environmental, territorial problems within the region to address. Regional Development Programme provides investments that are devoted to education, health, social services, sustainable mobility, environment, access to public services, investment attractiveness, business environment etc. (27% of total EU structural funds). The next step of the regional policy implementation was taken in January 2023, by approving the Description of the Procedure for Preparation and Implementation Monitoring of Sustainable Urban Development Strategies and Functional Zones’ Strategies. Regional centres (cities) are preparing Sustainable Urban Development Strategies to address social, economic, environmental and climate change challenges. Functional zones are created, and their strategies are prepared jointly by municipalities in order to increase the efficiency of the infrastructure and/or service network within the functional zones, to ensure all residents the access to this infrastructure and services, to create opportunities for joint actions of several municipalities covered by functional zone, and to implement joint investment projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

However, housing policies in recent years, constitutional modifications on agrarian property and the lack of rigorous application of planning and land use planning instruments, among other factors, have accelerated urban expansion over agricultural and natural areas (ENOT, 2020-2040).\nThis has brought socio-territorial inequalities that are manifested in the National Territorial System in which large cities concentrate services, jobs and infrastructure consuming resources indiscriminately, while their extensive and diffuse peripheries, as well as dispersed rural localities and indigenous communities, present serious problems of access to basic services and forms of subsistence in their environment. In addition, they do not have a mobility system that connects them, nor decent and safe housing, exacerbating the backwardness in which they live (PNOTDU 2021 - 2024).\nIn this sense, land-use planning requires effective and updated planning strategies and instruments in co-responsibility with the agencies involved in land-use planning, which allow for the articulation of ecological planning with the planning of human settlements and productive activities.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nSEDATU, as head of the land use and urban development sector, in accordance with the policy principles established in the General Law on Human Settlements, Territorial Planning and Urban Development (LGAHOTDU by its acronym in Spanish), developed the National Land Management Strategy 2020-2024 (ENOT by its acronym in Spanish), which sets out the direction in which Mexico should move over the next twenty years to achieve a more sustainable scenario in the use and exploitation of land resources.\nThe ENOT 2020-2040 identifies 6 macro-regions and 20 Urban-Rural Systems (SUR by its acronym in Spanish) that functionally structure the country to deepen the existing functional relationships between states, cities, metropolitan areas and rural localities.\nFor its part, the Territorial Planning and Urban Development National Programme 2021-2024 (PNOTDU by its acronym in Spanish) sets out six intrinsically related objectives with which it intends to move towards new territories:\n\nPromote a fair, balanced and sustainable territorial development model for the wellbeing of the population and its environment.\nPromote integrated development in Urban-Rural Systems and Metropolitan Areas.\nTransition to an urban development model oriented towards\nSustainable, orderly, equitable, just, and economically viable cities that reduce socio-spatial inequalities in human settlements.\nStrengthen the organizational, productive and sustainable development capacities of the agrarian sector, rural and indigenous and Afro-Mexican population and communities in the territory, with cultural relevance.\nPromote the integral habitat of the population in the adequate housing policy.\nStrengthen sustainability and adaptive capacities in the territory and its inhabitants\n\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nThe General Law on Human Settlements, Territorial Planning and Urban Development (LGAHOTDU, Article 8 section VII) establishes that the Ministry of Agrarian, Territorial and Urban Development (SEDATU) is responsible for planning, designing, promoting and evaluating financing mechanisms for regional, urban and rural development, with the participation of the Federal Public Administration and other levels of government, as well as to promote and execute the construction of infrastructure and equipment works for regional, urban and rural development to promote access for all to the services, benefits and prosperity offered by cities..\nLikewise, the National Development Plan (2019-2024) recognizes that under the principle of Leave no one behind, leave no one out and Economy for Well-being, regional projects will be designed to address specific needs, based on the following priority projects:\n\nMayan Train: infrastructure, socio-economic development and tourism project aimed at increasing the economic flow of tourism in the Yucatan Peninsula.\nProgramme for the Development of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec: its objective is to promote the growth of the regional economy with full respect for the history, culture and traditions of the Oaxacan and Veracruz Isthmus.\nNorthern Border Free Zone Programme: applied in the 43 border municipalities with the United States, offering development benefits (tax reductions, minimum wage increases, etc.).\n\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\n\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\n\nNational Development Plan 2019 – 2024\nSectoral Programme for Agrarian, Territorial and Urban Development 2020 -

The identification and definition of macro-regions and Urban-Rural Systems (SUR) are a way of deepening the functional relationships between states, cities, metropolitan areas, and rural localities. The SURs are basic spatial units that group together non-urbanized areas, urban centers and rural settlements that are functionally linked.\nTerritorial Planning Programme for the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Region (POT-RIT): Its objective is to establish an instrument that is the guiding axis that configures the territorial development of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region, through a model of sustainable, multi-scale, fair territorial planning with a systemic approach in the short, medium, and long term, which favors urbanization processes and the use of forms of occupation compatible with the territory, and the rational use and exploitation of its resources.\nLand Management Programme for the South-South-East Region: The main objective of the Programme, framed within the National Land Management Strategy (ENOT), is to generate a land management model and public policies in the short, medium, and long term, aimed at guiding sustainable, equitable and inclusive development and occupation in the territory, being the guiding axis for harmonizing state, metropolitan and municipal or local land planning instruments, linked to the National Land Policy.\nProgramme for the Development of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 2020-2024 (PDIT): Its objective is to promote the growth of the regional economy with full respect for the history, culture, and traditions of the Oaxacan and Veracruz Isthmus to generate the conditions for an inclusive economy that promotes the wellbeing of the population and guarantees a fair distribution of benefits.\n\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination at national level\nNational Council for Territorial Planning and Urban Development (CNOTDU): Consultative body on land-use planning and urban development made up of more than 40 agencies and entities of the Federal Public Administration, including eight State Secretariats: representatives of states and municipalities, the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate of the Republic, as well as society organizations. It seeks to be a tool for communication and coordination between the actors involved, as well as a mechanism for democratic planning and management where the active participation of the population is encouraged. Likewise, the Council is the consultative body whose attributions include the monitoring and evaluation of national land-use planning policies. Thus, the monitoring and evaluation of the ENOT will be carried out within this collegiate body\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\n\nNational Metropolitan Network (RENAMET): Its objective is to strengthen the metropolitan network through the exchange of coordination and territorial planning experiences within the framework of the binational agenda. It functions as a mechanism to promote the transfer of knowledge, methodologies, best practices, professionalization and information exchange, as well as the development of strategic projects within this territorial scale.\nState councils for territorial planning and urban development: The State Councils have the objective of contributing to improve public policies on urban and territorial development to build a national strategy with a long-term vision. These councils are a mandate derived from the LGAHOTDU, where there must be a national council and state and municipal replicas in conurbations and metropolitan regions of the country, to determine the policies and planning of urban and territorial development, to have different visions of the same problem and thus enrich the management of land use planning.\nMetropolitan Development Advisory Councils: The LGAHOTDU (Article 19) establishes that, in order to ensure consultation, opinion and deliberation of land use and urban development and metropolitan development planning policies, the federal entities, and municipalities, within the scope of their respective competences, will form the following auxiliary bodies of citizen participation and plural composition:\n\nThe State Councils for Territorial Planning and Urban Development.\nMetropolitan and conurbation commissions, and\nMunicipal councils for urban development and housing if necessary.\n\nMetropolitan planning commissions: They include the participation of different actors from the three levels of government, the private sector, civil society, and academia. Currently, 58 out of 74 Commissions are installed and meet according to the nature of each Metropolitan Zone. Since 2020, they have been chaired by Sedatu and their objective is to reach a consensus on decision-making with respect to land use planning and urban development.\n\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination at regional level\n\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring\nENOT Evaluation and Monitoring Working Group: The monitoring and evaluation of the ENOT 2020-2040 is coordinated by Sedatu with the participation of a Working Group for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the ENOT (WG) that is integrated by representatives of the different social, private and public sectors, and may request the necessary information from the State Councils for Territorial Planning and Urban Development (CEOTDU) to monitor the Strategy, analyze the information and prepare inputs for the presentation of progress, issue opinions and recommendations, and prepare reports to the National Council and State Councils for Territorial Planning and Urban Development.\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nENOT Vision 2020-2040: In twenty years’ time, ENOT should:\n\nIdentify the Urban-Rural Systems and regionalization that functionally structure the country, as well as guide the delimitation and characterization of strategic metropolitan areas to boost economic development and reduce regional disparities.\nTo propose measures for the sustainable development of the country's regions in terms of their natural resources, their productive activities and the balance between human settlements and their environmental conditions.\nPropose guidelines for the provision of infrastructure, equipment and facilities that are essential for the development of the regions and the country."

This project resulted in seven documents associated with the analysis of the Mexican Constitution and the General Law on Human Settlements, Land-Use Planning and Urban Development. This work, which has an impact on metropolitan public policy, was recently taken up again and has led to the presentation of the \"Initiative with draft decree, which reforms various provisions of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States regarding the right to sustainable development\", which seeks to reform the Fifth Title, as well as Articles 4, 73, 115 and 116 of the Mexican Constitution. It was presented in the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union on November 15, 2022; currently, the initiative with draft decree is pending opinion in the Commission of Constitutional Points and pending opinion in the Commission of Metropolitan Zones of the same Chamber of Deputies and can be consulted on the following web pages: http://sitl.diputados.gob.mx/LXV_leg/iniciativaslxv.php?comt=42&tipo_turnot=1&edot=P http://gaceta.diputados.gob.mx/Gaceta/65/2022/nov/20221108-II.html#Iniciativa24 Land management as public policy, INSUS 2020: The National Institute of Sustainable Land (INSUS in Spanish), a decentralised unit under SEDATU, has a central instrument for land management, which emphasises the integrated urban development approach, which is designed with elements such as: well-located urban land (intra-urban or contiguous to the urban area), a mix of different land uses for housing, equipment, economic activities, services; the mix of different housing typologies from self-produced, popular, medium social and residential, the integration of incentives, financing and public programmes; the development of land-based instruments for the management and financing of urban development (such as sale of development rights, contribution of improvements, transfer of potential, polygons of action), to guarantee the supply of land for those who have the least and to resolve the causes that generate irregularity. Mexican Official Standards: NOM-SEDATU-001-2021, Public Spaces in Human Settlements: In order to generate certainty in territorial planning processes at both national and local government level and to generate more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable spaces, NOM 001 was issued in February 2022. It has the specific function of setting out guidelines on management, planning, universal definitions, principles for the improvement, care and maintenance, progressive increase, comprehensive management, construction, and use of public spaces found in different cities of this extensive Mexican Republic. NOM-002-SEDATU-2022, Equipment in the instruments that make up the General Territorial Planning System. Classification, terminology, and application: In August 2022, NOM-002-SEDATU-2022 was published, which aims to define, classify, and prioritize the terminology used for the identification of public and private facilities in the preparation of the planning instruments of the General Territorial Planning System. Preliminary draft NOM that establishes the Guidelines for the Strengthening of the Territorial System: In 2022, the Preliminary Draft of the NOM that establishes the Guidelines for the Strengthening of the Territorial System to resist, adapt and recover from natural hazards and climate change through Land Use Planning was prepared, whose objective is to Strengthen the territorial system to resist, adapt and recover from natural hazards and climate change, through guidelines in land use planning instruments, under a socio-ecosystemic approach. Preliminary draft of the Mexican Official Standard, Integrated Risk Management: Non-urbanisable areas with environmental or cultural value or in areas with a high level of danger and exposure due to hydrometeorological, geological and climate change phenomena. Its objective is to establish criteria for Integrated Risk Management, through the characterization of non-urbanisable areas and their territorial planning within primary zoning. It will be obligatory in the elaboration of plans and programmes in matters of territorial planning and urban development and of basin councils for local governments, as well as in urban development plans and programmes, and will be incorporated into metropolitan zone and tourism planning programmes. For the formulation of mandatory guidelines, the National Risk Atlas should be considered as a reference framework. Harmonisation of land-use and ecological planning: SEDATU's General Directorate for Land Management is working on the project \"Integration of ecological, territorial and urban development planning programmes into a single instrument\", whose objective is the development and application of analysis and evaluation to contribute to sustainable territorial development, through strategies for the integration of ecological, territorial and urban development planning programmes into a single planning instrument, under a socio-ecosystemic approach to the territory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.006 lower in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating decreased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.053 higher in the same period, indicating bottom convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.33. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.044 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.238. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap decreased by 0.061 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was in 2020 and by percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Netherlands, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 14%, 4 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Netherlands, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the industrial sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions while the opposite was true for tradable services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors.

    "section": "Recent policy developments",
    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe Netherlands is a small and densely populated country with a rich urban structure. Cities and particularly functional urban areas are key pillars of the Dutch economy, hosting almost 75-80% of the national population. The structure of cities comprises a rich and very polycentric urban structure. In addition to the urban structure, the Netherlands is known for its polders and meadows. Almost half of the surface of this densely populated country has an agricultural function. The Netherlands has a diverse set of landscapes, with varying water and soil structures. The different landscapes face different challenges, related to its functions and water and soil structures. The Netherlands is a decentralised unitary State. It consists of national government, 12 provinces, 342 municipalities, 21 water boards, 2 metropolitan areas and many functional urban areas. There are housing associations and there is more regionalism along the lines of public order and safety, mobility, labor, health (not always congruent). The central government creates the legal framework and pre-conditions (including laws, regulations and funding). The decentralisation reinforced the provincial role in regional development and the municipal role in social and welfare services. However, the decentralisation did not (yet) go hand in hand with broad fiscal reforms, which provide more income and spending autonomy to the subnational governments. The Netherlands has a tradition of close cooperation between different layers of government in planning including the Dutch ‘polder model’ and cooperation between governmental levels. Public-sector authorities, companies and knowledge institutes join forces across sectors by means of permanent partnerships (each partner has its own role). Cooperation is based on policy and task orientation. The Dutch Approach is a combination of fostering self-reliance and protect/caring for the vulnerable whilst striving for economic growth. In a letter to Parliament1, the current government has expressed the need to take back control on spatial planning. This means that national government has the final say in the field of energy structures, urbanisation and rural areas. Urban and Rural strategy There is no explicit national urban policy framework, it is part of a broader policy. Next to the urban and rural areas, there is also attention for networks of areas. Many departments and levels of government and stakeholders are involved. Involvement of civil society is pursued. The energy transition and circular economy are aspects that are difficult to fit in both urban and rural areas. The national government creates the legal framework and preconditions (Environmental Planning Act (2022)) that determines the responsibilities of individual actors. It works based on a principle of subsidiarity, i.e., it gives powers to the lowest level of government if possible and to a higher level if necessary. The National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment ('NOVI') is the long-term (30 years) vision on the future development of the living environment in the Netherlands. The current government will update this strategy, in part due to increased challenges and complexity in accommodating current and future spatial claims to accommodate the energy and agricultural transitions and provide enough housing and working locations for an increasing population.  With an integrated approach to spatial (and urban) planning. National strategy, place based. Shared responsibility and good governance. Now working on an (adaptive) implementation agenda.  On urban and rural matters, the strategy focusses on two priorities: (1) urban strategy ‘Strong and healthy cities and regions’ and (2) rural strategy ‘Future proof development of rural areas’. The strategy has two special points of attention/s: (1) urban strategy ‘Strong and healthy cities and regions’ and (2) rural strategy ‘Future proof development of rural areas’:  Urban strategy: The Netherlands continues to work towards the development and expansion of the Netherlands Urban Network, with the aim of creating an easily accessible network of cities and regions.[1] (integrated urbanization strategy for development and quality improvement; urbanization ladder; urban regions: seven regional strategies for a coherent approach to housing, working/employment, mobility, and quality of the living environment in these regions; in these regions 17 development areas for large scale additional housing + ca. 400.000 in 10 years.) Rural strategy: Important to recognise the critical thematic fields such as agriculture, nature, water and biodiversity and cultural heritage. Goal is to a) contribute to optimal and integrated planning of all functions in these areas (for example agriculture, living, tourism, nature/biodiversity, energy transition); b.) to Influence the design of living environment in the rural areas towards & with public and private parties involved. This government started a long term program ‘national program rural areas’ (i.e., to meet international goals for nature, water and climate and to solve the nitrogen problem that blocks nature restoration).  In the updated NOVI, in addition to Urban and Rural, a third corner stone will be the necessary infrastructure for the energy transition and a transition to a circular economy. The Netherlands recognises the importance of the connection between urban and rural areas to seize opportunities for rural areas. Land is scarce in the Netherlands, so the whole of the country (land, water and airspace) is needed to cope with current challenges, such as climate change adaptation, energy transition and sustainable development. These are issues of enormous size and complexity. It is therefore very important that attention remains for the balanced development of all parts of the country. An area-specific effort is required for a longer period, because the resolving capacity differs per area depending on (among other things) the location, culture and the composition of the population. Today, the challenges that we face in the living environment have gotten more urgent. The demographic growth, economic growth and changing climate, combined with the challenges towards a climate neutral and circular economy and the international laws and regulations lead to an accumulation of spatial challenges. Therefore the national government is working on a new spatial strategy, an updated version of the NOVI. This new version, the ‘Nota Ruimte’, has three goals:  Taking control of national responsibility in spatial planning; Working on the execution of spatial vision towards a new time; Values towards spatial quality.  The water and soil system, the landscapes and the country’s rich urban structure will be the basis for the spatial strategy. The Netherlands will move towards a new balance between a thriving rural area, agricultural sector and nature. A future-proof transition regarding energy, raw materials, the circular economy and mobility is needed. The Netherlands strive towards strong cities and region with space for living and working.  Three-pronged approach to urban and rural policy The Netherlands’ policy approach to urban and rural development rests on three pillars:  Pillar 1 – Generic policy development: sectoral approach to laws/regulations/funding. Pillar 2 – Place-based approach: integrated, multilevel with a combination of the physical domain and economic and social aspects, such as:  As part of the execution program of the National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment (NOVEX), the national and provincial governments work towards ‘spatial arrangements’ in which the main challenges concerning spatially accommodating different developments (amongst others urbanisation, nature and agricultural transition, energy transition and circular economy) are identified and agreements are made how to accommodate these developments in a way that spatial quality is maintained and increased; Regional energy strategy and agenda; National programmes, e.g.,   Rotterdam South and Groningen; “Regiodeals”: former government EUR 1-billion deals aimed to increase social/physical living environment, based on regional specific insights in growth, prosperity beyond GDP and multilevel cooperation. The new government MEUR 900 deals to 2025 aim to strengthen regions beyond GDP based on regional specific co-financing. Action programmes, such as for ‘Demographic decline areas’ and for Border areas (incl Crossborder area agendas), notably the 2022 combined programme ‘Regions at the border’. Housing deals: 1 million houses needed by 2030. Performance agreements building, transformation and renovation per region as part of the Building Programme, which includes financial instruments[2] and looks at speeding up building process/regulations. (New) deprived areas (in cities) approach: it will integrate spatial, social, economic and safety dimensions, based on the 2022 National programme ‘Liveability and Safety’. In 20 districts, the goal is to increase the liability and safety of the most vulnerable areas in the Netherlands over the next 20 years, based on the experience of Rotterdam South. NOVEX areas: As part of the NOVI execution program (NOVEX), 16 NOVEX areas have been appointed where the national government provides additional execution force in cooperation with regional and local governments to cope with spatial challenges. In these areas, a combination of spatial challenges leads to a complex interaction between several domains in which close cooperation is needed to provide solutions. In 2023, implementation agendas will be drawn up2. NOVEX areas are generally divided into three types:  Urbanisation NOVEX areas, mostly related to challenges of housing, accommodating working locations, energy transition, climate change and nature development. Rural NOVEX areas, mostly related to challenges of soil subsidence, agricultural transition and livelihoods, shortages of water and (re)development of nature. Harbor areas, mostly related to the energy transition and transition to a circular economy (physically and environmentally) in already densely build up areas.     Pillar 3 – Thematic partnerships & innovation City Deals: Like within the EU, with the Urban Agenda for the EU Thematic Partnerships, the Netherlands has an national urban agenda and city deals (total 25 ongoing/ended). Examples include [3]:  Follow-up programme for 4 years – start 2021 (Based on experience with 25 city deals); City deals for regions/big/medium and small cities: coalition of willing & frontrunners, multi-level cooperation/stakeholder incl. business, new issues that cannot be resolved in the classic way; learning by doing, action orientated. The objectives of City Deals are to strengthen growth, innovation and quality of life in Dutch cities. In City Deals, concrete cooperation agreements are anchored between cities, central government, other authorities, companies and social organizations. These deals must lead to innovative solutions to social issues and / or contain measures to strengthen the economic ecosystem of the urban region(s). The aim is to connect ambitious and powerful players in the urban network In contrast to the Regio Deals, in the City Deal the central government does not provide co-financing for project/execution but makes process money available.   In the Netherlands, deal-making has become an important multi-level governance instrument with which different layers of government can form a partnership to address common socio-economic challenges at the regional level. One of these challenges is the recovery from the impact and inequalities brought forth by COVID-19.  Characteristics of regional dealmaking in the Netherlands that contribute to the recovery of the COVID-19 impact include:  The main focus is the well-being of citizens in a broad socio-economic sense that goes beyond GDP (‘brede welvaart’). The instrument is deployed as a means to tackle complex multi-faceted challenges on the regional level which existing sectoral policies are unable to adequately address. The approach is bottom-up: the objectives and plans have been drawn up by the regions themselves. The central government facilitates with co-financing, knowledge networks and sometimes by allowing some degree of flexibility in specific laws and regulations. This approach does justice to the existing regional differences and strengthens the vitality of the region at the same time. Co-financing from the central and local governments work as a catalyst for additional private investments.

This City Deal is investigating how digitalisation and the spreading of technology are leading to change in our cities, regions and villages and which tools we need to improve the liveability of our cities, while guaranteeing our democratic values.↩︎  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nSpatial Planning Act (SPA): This bill is currently under development. Once implemented, it will ensure better and more strategic planning for how a region will grow, adapt and change over time, and how land, infrastructure and other resources will be used to promote the wellbeing of people, the environment and the economy. It will introduce, for the first time, a consistent, formal framework for spatial planning in New Zealand. It will provide certainty and enable change and adaptation in regions, with positive outcomes for the environment, community wellbeing and resilience. The SPA’s core function will be to mandate the use of spatial planning, which would require central government, local government and Māori to work together to develop long-term regional spatial strategies that set regional directions for at least the next 30 years. Work is underway to implement the SPA this year. The roll out will initially focus on three regions. Natural and Built Environment Act (NBA): This bill is currently under development. It will be the main replacement for the Resource Management Act 1991. It aims to protect and restore the environment while better enabling development. The NBA will require any use of the environment to comply with environmental limits and targets. The environmental limits will be set at the current state of the natural environment at the time the NBA is passed to avoid further degradation. Associated targets will also be required to drive improvement in the natural environment. In areas that are already unacceptably degraded, minimum level targets will be required to improve the state of the environment, ensuring that existing degradation is not locked in. Climate Adaptation Act (CAA): This bill is currently under development. It aims to address complex issues associated with managed retreat alongside funding climate adaptation. This is currently being worked on and is likely to be considered by the Government in 2023. The Future for Local Government Review: The review identifies how New Zealand’s systems of local democracy and governance need to evolve over the next 30 years, in order to improve the wellbeing of New Zealand communities and the environment while actively embodying the Treaty partnership. This review is tasked with looking at what local government will do in the future, how it will be done and how it will be funded. The aim is to complete the review in June 2023. Industry Transformation Plans: The New Zealand Government has committed to an industry policy which seeks to grow and transform sectors of the economy with significant potential, which would contribute to a highly productive, high-wage and low emissions economy. Industry Transformation Plans are created in partnership by business, workers, Māori and government, setting a long-term vision for transformative change and identifying near-term actions that will shift the sector toward realising it. These plans are currently under development. The eight industry transformation plans are:  Advanced Manufacturing, Agritech, Construction, Digital Technologies, Fisheries, Food and Beverage, Forestry and Wood Processing, and Tourism \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The white paper on regional and rural (‘distrikt’) policy have the following themes and issues:  goal on population growth in rural areas. focus on small villages with the introduction of a pilot scheme for rural growth agreements. evaluation and testing of measures (e.g., free kindergarten) to reverse population decline and stimulate population growth particularly in Finnmark and North Troms in the high north. invest in broadband throughout the country and the possibility of decentralized work. Increased access to higher education in rural areas. The green shift provides new opportunities for industrial development and jobs in the rural areas. Lower fares on ferries and air travels in rural areas.  A regional and municipal reform was enforced in 2020, with a number of mergers both at the local and regional level.

Three specific objectives were also defined.\n• Objective 1 Increasing the cohesion of country’s social, economic, environmental and spatial development.\n• Objective 2 Strengthening regional competitive advantages.\n• Objective 3 Improving quality of management and implementation of territorially targeted policies.\nThe main objective of the regional policy until 2030 will be implemented based on three specific objectives that complement one another. The role of the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 is to connect and coordinate horizontal measures taken to implement objectives, which include strengthening the competitiveness of all regions, cities and rural areas (objectives 2 and 3) with objective 1 which ensures greater cohesion in the country’s development through providing support to areas that are economically weaker.\nThe regional policy until 2030 focuses actions on levelling up the living standard and development opportunities of medium-sized cities that struggle to cope with the effects of losing their industrial and administrative functions, and usually in rural areas – at risk of permanent marginalisation. It provides them with support that requires taking comprehensive measures tailored to the local character of actions. By supporting competitiveness of the regions, the policy assumes continued measures aimed at raising the quality of human and social capital and developing entrepreneurship and innovation. The strategy attaches great importance to developing competencies within public administration that are necessary for pursuing an effective development policy, in particular in territories with low development potential.\nHorizontal matters addressed by the objectives:\n• improving competitiveness of the regions based on making optimal use of their potential for development, having a proactive innovation policy, developing human and social capital in order to adjust their quality to the needs of the labour market and addressing infrastructural shortcomings,\n• improving access to public services, building a culture of solidarity, shared responsibility and cooperation,\n• improving the administrative potential and functioning of institutions, as well as their cooperation and active involvement in development activities.\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 174,\nNational Constitution\nAct on the principles of development policy,\nAct on the principles of implementing tasks financed from European funds in the financial perspective 2021-2027\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nIn 2021 the state budget’s expenditures in the part 34 (regional development) amounted to PLN 2,083.6 million, while the expenditures of the Budżet środków europejskich (Budget of EU funds) under the part 34 of while the respective expenditures on PLN 23,180.2 million.\nAccording to the budgetary bill for 2022 the equalization part of the state budget’s subsidy for gminas was planned at the level of PLN 9,6 billion, with the equalization part of the subsidy for voivodeships was planned at PLN 2.3 billion.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nNational Strategy for Regional Development 2030\nStrategy for Responsible Development for the period up to 2020 (including the perspective up to 2030)\nThe Partnership Agreement 2021-2027 for Poland covers 24 programmes (8 national programmes and 16 regional programmes) and 12 INTERREG programmes (concerning territorial cooperation).

The fundamental objective of the CCDP is to ensure coordination of the process of designing and implementing the development policy, as well as strategic monitoring and evaluation of the instruments serving its implementation.\n2) the sub-committee for territorial dimension takes over tasks related to monitoring the NSRD. It also provides a broad forum for discussion and expert background for the implementation and monitoring of the country's regional policy. Its tasks include coordination of sectoral policies and instruments financed from various sources, for the socio-economic development of the country; formulation of recommendations concerning effectiveness, efficiency and usefulness of implemented intervention and applied instruments in sectoral policies and regional policy (including individual regions); co-ordination and formulation of recommendations concerning strategic projects indicated in the National Strategy for Regional Development and implemented on the basis of other strategic documents at the national level with a significant territorial impact.\nJoint Central Government and Local Government Committee encompassing representatives of state units of the territorial government.

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.074 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.045 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.954. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.004 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.426. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.007 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.306 in 2020 and increased by 0.016 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Poland, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity decreased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 66%, 17 percentage points less than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to narrow. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Poland, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in regions that used to be located in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution while it went up in regions located in the lower half. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in regions that used to be located in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution while it remained stable in the rest. Hence, the evolution of employment shares both in the industrial and in the tradable services sectors reduced the labour productivity gap between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors.

    "section": "Recent policy developments",
    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\nThe Polish Government is embarking on a wide-ranging reappraisal of the institutional and policy context for regional development. Directions for the policy were set out in the Strategy for Responsible Development (SOR), launched in 2017 and the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 (NSRD), launched in 2019. These included the objective of increased cohesion, with a mix of both regional and local integrated strategies, and place-based project intervention. Of particular note is an increased focus on ‘areas of strategic intervention’, increasing the emphasis on small and medium sized towns, medium sized cities losing their socio-economic functions and peripheral, rural or declining areas, alongside the main urban centres (areas at risk of permanent marginalisation). The persistence of territorial disparities in socio-economic, environmental and institutional conditions, particularly at sub-regional levels and the territorially differentiated impact of the pandemic has underlined the importance of these new policy directions. Over the past year, a range of measures have been undertaken to build on these initiatives with the overall aim of strengthening the territorial dimension in development policy. This is seen as central to successfully implementing Poland’s National Strategy for Regional Development, and to efficient use of EU Cohesion Policy. The regional strategies have been updated based on National Strategy for Regional Development. At the moment the work is underway on a new long-term vision document National Development Concept 2050. This will not act as a strategy with priorities and goals but rather sets out scenarios of development which will be used to update medium term strategy – the Strategy for Responsible Development and also the National Regional Development Strategy and sectoral strategies. The Concept is based on the identification of key issues (e.g., demographic change, climate change etc.) and it will develop scenarios around these with cross-cutting social, economic and territorial dimensions. At supra-local level, a functional approach and cooperation of local governments is promoted, supra-local development strategies and strategies for EU territorial instruments are created. In the Strategy for Responsible Development and the National Strategy for Regional Development the project approach is implemented as a way of implementation. As a result, various projects are being implemented to support development and local authorities, e.g. Local Development, the Advisory Support Centre, the Cities' Partnership Initiative. The Advisory Support Centre (ASD) is a NSRD strategic project with the main goal of strengthening the administrative efficiency of these local governments (municipalities and counties), including improving their competences in strategic management and initiating and implementing comprehensive development projects in partnership with neighbouring local governments. ASD pilot was launched in September 2020. The aim of this project is to support local government administration, especially this which are at risk of permanent marginalisation, in preparing development projects, multifaceted and integrated, which play a major role in improving the socio-economic situation in a functional area. The activities within the project contribute to improve administrative efficiency in local governments, and, as a result – better implementation of public policies. Continuation of ASD project is ASD Plus. The aim of the ASD Plus project is to strengthen the competences of municipalities and counties to manage strategic local development in socio-economic partnerships. In the field of urban policy framework in Poland – the new guidelines for cities and central administration were adopted - National Urban Policy 2030 (NUP 2030). Since 2015, when the first Polish NUP was adopted, main urban challenges such as climate crisis, urban sprawl or house deficit have not disappeared but even intensified. In addition, urban areas must face new difficulties – pandemic, refugee crisis and economic instability. Having in mind the dynamically changing world and arising challenges Poland puts more emphasis on above topics and underlines the need for cities to be flexible, resilient and transformative. The National Urban Policy 2030 defines six goals that are part of the vision for long-term urban development. These goals are defined as: compact, green, productive, smart, accessible and efficient city. Moreover, NUP focuses on balancing territorial inequalities. An integrated territorial approach adopted in this document aims to affect both cities and their functional areas in order to bring improvement in the entire area, provide cohesion and ensures rational spending of money and minimization of social and environmental costs. An important part of NUP 2030 is the implementation plan. The document introduces a dedicated Executive Council for implementation of NUP composed of sectoral ministries and cities associations. The coordination and cooperation of different actors at national and regional level is the key to successful implementation of NUP 2030 goals. National Urban Policy 2030 consists of several instruments, legal, organizational and financial solutions that help to implement goals set in the document. Within organisation of 11th World Urban Forum in Katowice, Poland developed one of the strategic projects of NUP 2030 - Action Plan for Cities initiative - under which over 100 cities received individual advisory support in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the local level. As part of the project was created \"Action Plan for Cities\" - a catalogue of projects implemented by the cities participating in the project; The \"Handbook\" - a collection of good practices in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in cities and the \"Toolbox for Local Communities\", which is an online encyclopaedia for residents containing a knowledge base on how they can influence urban space and city management processes. One of the strategic projects of the National Urban Policy 2030 is the Cities' Partnership Initiative (CPI). The CPI is a programme for the exchange and promotion of knowledge between cities and other actors involved in the formulation and implementation of urban policy also from national level. It is a response to the need voiced by local governments to exchange knowledge and experience between cities and other entities involved in shaping and implementing urban policy, as well as to obtain ideas on how to strengthen the development potential of Polish cities. The main objective of the initiative is to improve development conditions and to support integrated and sustainable development of Polish cities, including solutions useful for improving management efficiency. In the pilot edition of the project, 34 cities participated in the work of the three thematic networks on urban mobility, regeneration, and air quality between 2017 and 2019. In 2021, a new edition of the project was launched with 30 cities participating. This time, work is being carried out within the following thematic networks: Digital City, Green City, City of PPP initiatives. Further editions of the project are planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The goal of promote growth in all regions is reflected in the vision defined in Strategy Portugal 2030 “Recover the economy and protect jobs, and make the next decade a recovery and convergence of Portugal with the European Union, ensuring greater resilience and social and territorial cohesion.” Promoting territorial cohesion will be mandatory to counteract territorial inequalities, as established in the integrated strategy for the valorisation of inland territories (RCM nº 18/2020), based on attracting/fixing population, promoting private investment to create jobs, stimulating the knowledge and innovation transfer from the academy to the socioeconomic tissue, and guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest. Institutional changes The current main developments related to the regional institutional framework, in Portugal, are the reforms on the administrative decentralization to the municipalites (as well to the intermunicipal cooperation and parishes) and administrative deconcentration to the CCDR (Regional Development and Coordination Commissions). Portugal is expanding its subnational policy footprint through decentralization. The Law n. º 50/2018, of 16th of August, and related legislation have provided municipalities (in lato sensu, including metropolitan areas, intermunicipal communities and parishes, as well) with new competences, responsibilities and resources granting more proximity to its citizens and efficiency to the public policy. Traditionally, Portugal has highly centralized governmental structure with a lower proportion of public spending in the subnational levels, than the EU and OECD averages. This process might change the status quo, reinforcing local-based policies and stakeholders. Recently, the Portuguese government approved the administrative deconcentrating reform to the CCDRs, which will acquire the status of special public institutes, with the objective of carrying out deconcentrated competences of the central administration and provide better public services to citizens, working as one-stop-shop in a regional level, and provider of services of general interest (e.g., health, education, culture, agriculture, and others) in its territory. In a country without regional level, in the mainland, this process is considered a steppingstone to a future debate about regionalisation process. Along with this, a process of revision for NUTS II was developed to make them coherent with the area covered by CCDR. EU Structural Funds The Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement (Portugal 2030) between the EU Commission and Portugal, adopted in July 2022, sets out investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 with a total of €23 billion to support the economic, social and territorial cohesion until the end of the decade. The 7 regional programmes will have a total of €9,7 billion and are particularly focused on territorial policies and investments, which are reinforced by the ongoing decentralization process in the mainland and contributes to the European strategic objectives: a Europe closer to citizens, a greener Europe and a more competitive Europe. The new Just Transition Fund will support three subregions impacted by the closure of two coal-fired power plant (in Médio Tejo and Alentejo Litoral) and one refinery (in Matosinhos, Metropolitan Area of Porto). As concerns the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), one of its key objectives is to promote social and territorial cohesion. Portugal’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) accounts to almost €17 billion, with more than €11 billion allocated to the “resilience dimension”, more than €3 billion destined to the “climate transition” and almost €2,5 billion to the “digital transition”. In general, the use of the RRF versus Cohesion Policy funds is guided by eligibility, competences, timing and investment scale. The national government has focussed its investment on human resources within administrations, strengthening the capacities for effective management of public investment particularly at territorial level. Public policy The National Investment Programme 2030 (PNI 2030) aims to be the planning tool for the next cycle of strategic and structural investments at national level, to meet the needs and challenges of the next decade and decades to come. The scope of the PNI 2030 is multisectoral, focusing on the mobility and transport sectors, key factors for the country’s external competitiveness and internal cohesion, the environment, energy and irrigation, fundamental to face the challenges of decarbonization and energy transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.074 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.022 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.884. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap decreased by 0.016 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.813 in 2020 and increased by 0.067 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Slovak Republic, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2001 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 68%, 7 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap continued to widen. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Slovak Republic, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector widened the labour productivity gap between regions while the opposite was true for the industrial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries.

As a result, around 90% of the population is spread over 30% of the land. Also, as Eurostat data shows, the population density in Spain in 2019 stood at 93.8 people per square kilometer, below the EU average of 109 inhab./km2 . Moreover, based on municipal organization data, municipalities with 5,000 or fewer inhabitants represent (as of January 1, 2021) 83.9% of the total, although they host about 5.69 million people, or 12% of the total Spanish population. At the same time, a significant number of municipalities with between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants also present worrying patterns of depopulation and ageing population. Specifically, on January 1, 2021, from the 899 municipalities between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants, 36% have lost population in the period 2016-2021 and in more than a third of these locations (35%), at least 20% of the population is over 65 years old.\nSpain has the longest life expectancy in the EU, with 20% of the population aged 65+ and 1/3 of this share is 80+.\nIn rural areas and intermediate cities, the proportion of older people is higher (38-48% for rural areas, and 31% of the total population for intermediate regions). Also, the effect of tourism increases the disparities, due to the floating population effect and large seasonal population increases, mostly concentrated in highly densely populated coastal areas where land use pressure and cost is intensified.\nIn addition, depopulated areas suffer from higher masculization ratios, young brain drain loss, salary and digital gaps, smaller sized companies which, among other factors, typically result in lower productivity and innovation rates compared to urban areas.\n\n\nObjectives of regional policy\nGiving the above described situation, the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic created in October 2020 the General Secretariat of Demographic Challenge, with the following duties (approved by Royal Decree 500/2020):\n\nThe preparation, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial administrations, and the proposal and promotion, within the scope of the General State Administration, of the general objectives, strategies and plans and priority actions regarding the demographic challenge.\nThe coordination of other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations in matters of the demographic challenge, as well as the promotion of public-private collaboration for the achievement of the objectives related to the demographic challenge.\nThe functions that the Law for the Sustainable Development of the Rural Environment of 2007 attributes to the General State Administration.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competencies of other ministerial departments, of equal opportunities and non-discrimination based on residence and age, as well as the promotion and safeguarding, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations, of the appropriate provision of basic services to the entire population, under conditions of equity, with special attention to children, youth and the elderly.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competences of other ministerial departments, of the role of women in rural areas, as well as the social and labor inclusion of immigrants in areas at demographic risk.\nThe coordination of policies aimed at promoting the reconciliation of family and professional life, co-responsibility, child rearing and the development of family projects, especially in the areas most affected by demographic risks.\nThe coordination of public policies, within the scope of the General State Administration, aimed at promoting awareness, knowledge and training, from childhood and youth, and throughout life, which enhance the value of the territory, especially in rural areas, and promote the knowledge and revitalization of existing opportunities in areas affected by depopulation.\nThe promotion, without prejudice to the competencies of other ministerial departments, of investment, employment opportunities, diversification and economic development, with the aim of strengthening the socioeconomic fabric in areas affected by depopulation.\nThe promotion and encouragement, in collaboration with the other ministerial departments and the territorial public administrations, of the adequate dimensioning of the infrastructures and equipment necessary to face the demographic challenge.\nThe promotion and encouragement, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and territorial public administrations, of policies aimed at addressing the progressive aging and the effects of the floating population.\nParticipation in representation of the Ministry in international organizations and monitoring of international agreements on the demographic challenge.\n\nParticipation in representation of the General State Administration in Councils of the European Union in matters of demographic challenge and other international organizations.\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 174.\n2030 National Strategy for Demographic Challenge: It establishes the objectives and strategic lines of action to advance in territorial cohesion and fight against depopulation.\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nThe General Secretariat was created on January 29, 20203 as a result of the integration of the competences on demography and its problems in the Ministry of Ecological Transition.\nFor the exercise of its functions, the General Secretariat was endowed with a management body, the General Directorate for Policies against Depopulation, and a Technical Office to assist the Secretary General.

The Riksdag approved it in June 2022 in accordance with the proposal of the Committee on Industry and Trade. The strategy highlights three basic prerequisites for effective implementation:  capacity for regional and local development work regional consideration and cooperation between state agencies, regions and other actors, as well as learning through analysis, follow-up, evaluation and research.  In the strategy, there are four strategic areas that will form the basis for the implementation of the regional development policy 2021–2030.

This economic development program promotes projects, initiatives, and programs that improve the economic framework conditions for entrepreneurial activities and sustainably enhance innovation capacity, value creation, and, thus, competitiveness. In this way, the Swiss regional policy contributes to creating and preserving jobs in the regions concerned. Indirectly, it contributes to the decentralized use of the territory and the reduction of regional disparities.\n\n\nLegal/institutional framework for regional policy\n700 / Federal act on Spatial Planning\n700.1 / Ordinance on Spatial Planning\n709.17 / Ordinance on coordination and cooperation in spatially relevant federal tasks\n901.0 / Federal Law on Regional Policy\n901.021 / Ordinance on Regional Policy\n910.1 / Federal Act on Agriculture\n19.016 / Message on economic promotion for the years 2020 – 2023\n\n\nBudget allocated to regional development (i.e., amount) and fiscal equalisation mechanisms between jurisdictions (if any)\nApproximately CHF 320 million are available to regional development for the years 2016 to 2023. On the fiscal equalization mechanisms, we possess the National fiscal equalization. Federalism is one of Switzerland’s fundamental principles. The 26 cantons and 2,148 communes have extensive powers. Fiscal equalization is thus also important for the unity of the country. It is based on the principle of solidarity: the economically strong cantons and the Confederation help out the economically weaker cantons.\n\n\nNational regional development policy framework\nBroader Sense: Swiss Umbrella strategy on “coherent spatial development” which aims at aligning spatial effects of sectoral and regional policies in urban and rural areas and their interlinkages\nNarrow Sense: The New Regional Policy (NRP) is the Swiss national regional development policy framework based on the Federal Law on Regional Policy.\nRegional innovation system\nInterreg programs A / B & C\n\n\nUrban policy framework\nThrough the agglomeration policy (AggloPol), the federal government supports Switzerland's agglomerations with their cities and municipalities in further sustainable development. Several specific measures are available for the implementation of the policy. These complement the measures of various sectoral policies, such as transport or social policies. As a cross-cutting policy, AggloPol also provides a framework of objectives and actions for implementing and coordinating the various sectoral policies in urban areas.\n\n\nRural policy framework\nPERM - Policy for rural areas and mountain regions\nThe New Regional Policy (NRP)\nThe agricultural policy\n\n\nMajor regional policy tools (e.g., funds, plans, policy initiatives, institutional agreements, etc.)\n26 Cantonal development policies are active and work with the government to enhance each region and answer their particular needs.\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination at national level\nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs, Regional and spatial planning policy\n\n\nMulti-level governance mechanisms between national and subnational levels (e.g., institutional agreements, Committees, etc.)\nConference of Cantonal Services\n\n\nPolicy co-ordination tools at regional level\n\n\n\nEvaluation and monitoring tools\nRegional systems of evaluation and monitoring\nRegular extern assessments\nGovernmental Indicators (outcomes / output) from defined objectives\n\n\nFuture orientations of regional policy\nBroader Sense: Strategy on coherent spatial development undergoes an actualization.\nNarrow Sense: With the program 2024-2017, the future orientations of the NRP will enter its third eight-year period (2024-2031). The former priority themes of \"Industry / Innovation\" and \"Tourism\" will be maintained. Smaller infrastructures can now be supported under certain conditions with non-repayable contributions. In addition to \"local economy,\" which complements the export-oriented approach of NPR, sustainability, and digitalization will be particularly important cross-cutting themes."

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2008 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.028 lower in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating decreased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0.018 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.11. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap decreased by 0.057 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.183 in 2020 and decreased by 0.077 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn Switzerland, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity remained stable between 2011 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity grew roughly by 6% in both groups of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Switzerland, between 2011 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions, approximately by the same amount. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions, approximately by the same amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors. Tradable services include Information and communication (J), Financial and insurance activities (K), Real estate activities (L), Professional, scientific and technical activities (M), Administrative and support service activities (N).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022)."

The NPR supports innovation in SMEs at the business-to-business level in rural areas, mountain regions, and border regions. This support is provided mainly through the six \"Regional innovation systems\" (RIS), which promote competitiveness and innovation capacity, help for access to technological innovation and innovation that goes beyond technological innovation, offer support and coordinated services in the areas of information, advice, networking, infrastructure, and financing. Tourism: Tourism is vital to the regional economy, especially in mountain regions. The NPR encourages the development of new tourism offers and innovative products in this field. It also promotes collaborative projects between destinations and participates in financing tourism infrastructures that increase value creation in the region. Digitalisation: Digitalisation affects all areas of the economy. NPR supports and promotes digitalisation projects within its scope of impact. It also invests in awareness-raising and networking measures to prevent regions from being left behind in the digital age. In addition to these priorities mentioned above, for the period 2024-2027, sustainability and social innovation will become central. As a result, projects in these areas will be fostered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

The figures are normalized, with values in the year 2000 set to 1.\nThe Top 20%/Mean ratio was 0.061 higher in 2020 compared to 2000, indicating increased polarisation. The Bottom 20%/Mean ratio was 0 lower in the same period, indicating bottom divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between large metropolitan and non-large metropolitan regions was 1.078. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.475. This gap increased by 0.035 percentage points between 2000 and 2020.\nMeanwhile, in 2020, the gap in GDP per capita between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions was 1.111. For reference, the same value for OECD was 1.325. This gap increased by 0.069 percentage points since 2000.\nIn turn, the gap in GDP per capita between regions near and far a Functional Urban Area (FUA) of more than 250 thousand inhabitants was 1.16 in 2020 and decreased by 0.031 percentage points since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Far from a FUA&gt;250K includes regions near/with a small FUA and remote regions. OECD mean gap based on 1 586 TL3 regions in 27 countries with available data (no TL3 data for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Luxembourg and Switzerland).\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nIn United Kingdom, the gap between the upper and the lower half of regions in terms of labour productivity increased between 2004 and 2019. Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 10%, 3 percentage points more than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap narrowed down. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.\nSource: OECD Regional Database (2022).\n\nRegions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In United Kingdom, between 2004 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions, approximately by the same amount. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in all regions but more so in regions that used to be in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution. Hence, the evolution of employment shares in the tradable services sector reduced the labour productivity gap between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. The share of workers in a given sector for a group of regions is defined as the sum of employment in that sector within the group divided by the sum of total employment within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability. Industry includes the following tradable goods sectors: Mining and quarrying (B), Manufacturing (C), Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (D) and Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation activities (E) NACE macro sectors.

    "text": "Recent policy developments\n\n\n\nThere is no explicit regional development policy framework since the Regional Development Agencies in England were closed in 2010. However, since 2011 the UK Government has shifted its focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships, of which there are currently 38, to bring together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England and deliver some government programmes including the Local Growth Fund, Getting Building Fund and programmes linked to skills development. The three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have responsibility for urban, regional and spatial planning policies in their areas, but the UK Government has established offices in all three territories to help deliver UK wide levelling-up programmes such as the Levelling Up Fund, UK Shared Prosperity Fund and Communities Opportunities Fund, among other initiatives. With the launch of the Levelling Up White Paper in 2022, there has been an enhanced programme of spreading opportunity to all parts of the country and the three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Since 2011, in England the government has shifted focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships and has pursued a policy of devolving more power and resources to local and combined authorities such as Mayoral Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities. Devolution is at the heart of the UK Government’s plans to increase economic growth and level up the whole country. The Government announced the biggest ever transfer of powers away from Westminster in the Levelling Up White Paper. It is committed to further extending devolution across England and seeing more empowered and accountable local leaders who can drive growth, innovate, and respond to the specific challenges and needs of their areas. Six new devolution deals were announced in 2022 to drive forward improved outcomes for over 7.2million people that live in those areas by directly electing a mayor/leader to represent them in the future. The six deals agreed in 2022 will bring devolution to over 52% of the English population, up from 41% in 2021. The new deals agreed in 2022 will see over £4bn invested in local areas over a period of 30 years. Once mayors are elected, these deals will give their mayors and leaders greater local control over things like transport, infrastructure and skills. Discussions with places to identify potential candidates for the next set of new devolution deals is well underway in 2023. For over 11 years 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have brought together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England. They have also been responsible for the delivery of a number of funding streams that have provided support to businesses and invested in local infrastructure. Since publication of the Levelling Up White Paper, strong progress has been made on extending devolution across England. To this end, the UK Government intends for the functions of LEPs to be delivered by democratically elected local leaders where appropriate in the future, and where they are not already delivered by Combined Authorities. It is minded to withdraw core funding for LEPs from April 2024. To minimise any disruption for LEPs, the areas they support, and delivery of Government programmes the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and the Department for Business and Trade are consulting LEPs and other key stakeholders on this proposal. An eight-week information gathering exercise was launched on 17 March, before confirming a decision (consultation closes on 19 May). The Government will publish an updated policy position to confirm next steps by summer 2023. The Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are largely responsible for regional economic development and spatial planning in their territories. The Welsh Government published “Future Wales - the National Plan 2040” in February 2021. This sets out the national development plan and spatial strategy for Wales. Scotland published a 4th update to its National Planning Framework in February 2023. This provides a national spatial strategy for Scotland setting out its spatial principles, regional priorities and national planning policy. Northern Ireland has a Regional Development Strategy 2035. This puts in place spatial planning, transport and housing priorities to support economic growth and regional prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"

This includes rural areas, tribal lands, and minorities such as Black, Latino, and American Indian populations. The U.S. is taking a whole of government approach to address regional inequalities. In terms of new initiatives, a key example is EDA’s recent $3 billion American Rescue Plan program to meet the urgent needs of American communities for economic recovery and resiliency in face of the pandemic. In 2022, EDA made 780 grants awarded through six innovative programs to support transformational American Rescue Plan projects. EDA’s American Rescue Plan grant programs include:  Build Back Better Regional Challenge: $1 billion awarded to 21 regional coalitions (5-8 component awards per coalition), each of which received between $25 million and $65 million to transform their regional economy by growing an industry sector. EDA also gave awards to 60 phase 1 finalists to support the development of their ambitious projects. Good Jobs Challenge: $500 million awarded to 32 industry-led workforce training partnerships to invest in innovative approaches to workforce development that will secure job opportunities for more than 50,000 Americans. Economic Adjustment Assistance program: $500 million awarded to 256 diverse projects —including but not limited to enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities and planning grants — to address the economic development needs of communities today while preparing them for the future by in investing in enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities, and planning grants. Indigenous Communities program: $100 million awarded to 51 grantees to support economic development projects in Indigenous communities for similar types of projects as described under Economic Adjustment Assistance. Across all six American Rescue Plan programs, inclusive of the Indigenous Communities program, EDA awarded a total of 127 grants totalling $448 million. Travel, Tourism & Outdoor Recreation program: $750 million awarded to 185 grantees to help support regions hard hit by declines to these industries through projects to build new tourist attractions (museums, event venues, hiking trails, campgrounds, etc.), develop tourism-related economic plans, and support workforce training in the tourism sector. Statewide Planning, Research & Networks: $1 million planning grants to each of the 59 U.S. states and territories and $31 million to 14 research and networks (also known as Communities of Practice) grantees. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerritorial definitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in this note reflect different sub-national geographic levels in OECD countries. In particular, regions are classified on two territorial levels reflecting the administrative organisation of countries: large regions (TL2) and small regions (TL3).\n\n\nSmall regions are classified according to their access to metropolitan areas (Fadic et al. 2019). The typology classifies small (TL3) regions into metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions according to the following criteria:\n\n\n\nMetropolitan regions, if more than half of the population live in a FUA. Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\n\nNon-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: https://oecdcode.org/disclaimers/territories.html"
