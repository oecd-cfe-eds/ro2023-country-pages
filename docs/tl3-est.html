There has been no significant trend towards territorially more balanced development in recent years also.</p>
<p>• More active economic activity and attractive/profitable jobs are concentrating in larger urban regions, and regional differences in economic growth are deepening.</p>
<p>• Demographic changes, especially internal migration of younger people towards largest urban areas are generating regional shrinkage outside major urban areas and is weakening the development prospects of these shrinking regions.</p>
<p>• Local governance, investment and development capacity (e.g in delivery of quality public services) is still uneven across municipalities. Municipalities in larger urban areas with more favourable demographic structure have normally higher and remote, sparsely populated municipalities located further away from cities lower capacity.</p>

<p>• Promoting financial autonomy of local municipalities and reducing the political dependency from the central government when it comes to the formation of their tax base;</p>
<p>•Transferring some complementary state government responsibilities/functions to local municipalities and increasing decentralisation in public governance, along with ensuring the necessary revenue base;</p>

The Ministry is also in charge of the issues of territorial administration and setting financial management principles for local authorities. The Ministry also designs and coordinates the implementation of regional development (e.g. rural and urban areas) grant schemes and development of regional public transport.</p>
<p>The other ministries also contribute to development of regions and cities by coordinating specific sectorial policies having a stronger territorial relevance:</p>
<p>• Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is responsible for housing, urban transport, business development, energy, ICT and digital society, innovation and R&amp;D policies having significant importance to development of regions;</p>

<p>Ministry of Education and Research, as being responsible for education policy, school network and R&amp;D policies and relevant funding instruments.</p>

This calculation does not include the other sectorial policy grants reaching also to different regions of Estonia.</p>
<p>The fiscal equalisation mechanism forms 107,4 million euros (2023), which represents 3,6% of total local government income.</p></td>

<td>National regional development policy framework</td>
<td><p>Since 2021 we have no longer had a holistic national regional development strategy being valid for all sectorial ministries. Nevertheless, regional development goals, e.g to ensure a more balanced territorial development and consideration of different territorial needs through sectorial policy strategies is set within the National Development Strategy “Estonia 2035”.</p>
<p>There is also a new Regional Development Action Plan (RDAP) in place since 2022. The RPAP defines the most eminent socio-economic inequalities of regional development seen as major challenges/root-problems of regional development in Estonia, and creates a framework for monitoring these processes. It also sets more detailed 4-year action plan covering different sectorial policy activities to alleviate these root problems and support more even regional development.</p>
<p>Besides, there is a regional development program for 4-year period (being updated annual-basis), which sets up the implementation plan for the ministry responsible for regional policy in Estonia (Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture). This document is also a basis for planning 4-years state budget strategy.</p>
<p>At regional level there are 15 county<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> development strategies in place, developed jointly by the local municipalities of the county. Although there is a general requirement that the county development strategies and national level policy strategies are consistent and consider each other’s priorities, there are no binding mechanisms to ensure this in practice.</p>
<p>There is no official regional policy council or advisory group or other such institution currently in Estonia at government level coordinating the development and implementation of regional policy across sectorial ministries and levels of governance.</p></td>

<td>Urban policy framework</td>
<td><p>Estonia does not have an explicit national urban policy or national strategy for urban development. The urban development issues have addressed within a broader national regional policy framework.</p>
<p>E.g. specific grant schemes for development of 5 largest urban areas of Estonia are applied being funded from the European Regional Development Fund of 2021-27. These grant schemes aim to support investments in innovative digital solutions and green infrastructure of Estonian largest urban areas and revitalization of the largest urban areas in North-Eastern Estonia.</p>
<p>One soft coordination initiative is a national network of urban development specialists. This is an informal multilevel governance and collaboration platform, assembling officials of urban municipalities in charge or strategic development and spatial planning of their cities/towns and the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities. And involving also the representatives from central government body responsible for regional and urban development policy, other relevant ministries.</p></td>

<p>Rural development is under the primary responsibility of the Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture. The ministry e.g. coordinates Estonia’s rural development policy, implements the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy for Estonia and develops/implements the Estonian strategic Rural Development Plans.</p>
<p>Rural development is also an integral part of the national regional policy and its incentives. The Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture is in charge of designing and implementing territorial development policies which is largely addressed to specificities and challenges of rural areas.</p>

<p>• National Development Plans for North-Eastern and South-Eastern regions of Estonia until 2030;</p>
<p>• According to the Government of the Republic Act planning and general co-ordination of regional development lies under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>• Mechanism and guideline document for impact assessment of legislative acts and national policy strategies, which e.g requires assessment of impacts on regional development and rural areas.</p>
<p>• The national Government has given a task to the sectorial ministries to take into account the regional development challenges and impacts in designing foreign aid support measures funded from the EU funds of 2021-2027 and plan concrete solutions to strengthen their compliance with the balanced territorial development target. A special guideline has also been prepared for this process with providing potential solutions how to promote this compliance in practice.</p></td>

<p>• A national network of County Development Organisations (as soft coordination mechanism), which represent local municipalities of each certain county and performs also as a multilevel collaboration and policy discussions with ministries. The network convenes regularly mainly to exchange important information, best practices, initiate consultations on different territorial development related issues between counties (horizontally) and with the ministries (vertically).</p>
<p>• Similar national network of urban development specialists also exists assembling officials of urban municipalities in charge or strategic development and spatial planning of their cities/towns and the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities. And involving also the representatives from central government body responsible for regional and urban development policy, other relevant ministries.</p>
<p>• The principles of how national level sectoral development strategies, county development strategies and local government development plans have to consider and support each other's priorities and strive towards stronger coherence are specified in new draft of Local Governments Act, the strategic planning guidelines issued by the State Government Office and guidelines for preparation of county development strategies.</p>

Both documents bring together incentives of different ministries/sectoral policies for development of these regions and include only activities initiated by the central government.</p>
<p>• As a new initiative, the Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture is piloting regional development agreements/’deals’ in parallel with setting up regional councils mandated for coordination of their further elaboration and implementation, starting with the pilot areas of Central- and South-Estonia. The regional agreements will be anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in region larger than a county.</p></td>

There are around 15-20 indicators to monitor regional disparities in major regional policy challenges/root problems. These indicators have been set in accordance with the strategic objectives of the „Estonia 2035“ strategy and their monitoring indicators at national level. Thereby monitoring the implementation of the Regional Development Action Plan simultaneously enables to assess also how the goals of the national development strategy are reached in territorial dimension.</p>
<p>Monitoring dashboard minuomavalitsus.ee (<a href="https://minuomavalitsus.fin.ee/en">https://minuomavalitsus.fin.ee/en</a>). The aim is observe the quality and satisfaction with local governments’ services all over Estonia. The dashboard analyses and visualises hundreds of criteria of the state of local governments’ services. It enables to get an overview of the state of services and development possibilities in each local government, compare local governments’ service levels which contributes to sharing experiences, raise public awareness of the organisation of local services and increase citizens’ informed involvement in discussing local development priorities and needs.</p>

<p>• Facilitating multilevel governance and sectorial coordination at regional level larger than counties - by piloting regional development agreements/’deals’ and setting up regional councils mandated for coordination of their further elaboration and implementation.</p>
<p>• Promoting financial capacity and autonomy of local municipalities and reducing the political and fiscal dependency from the central government.</p>
<p>• Increasing the role of local governments and their responsibilities in the development of the business environment.</p>
<p>• A shift towards more flexible and efficient allocation of regional development grant schemes, also by decreasing their fragmentation.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Top/bottom calculated as population equivalent (top/bottom regions with at least 20% of the population). The interpretation of top/bottom 20% GDP per capita is that 20% of the population in the country holds 20% of the value. Top 20%/Mean calculated as mean GDP per capita in top 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. Bottom 20%/Mean calculated as mean TL3 GDP per capita in bottom 20% regions over mean TL3 GDP per capita in a given year. To improve data consistency, input series are aggregated when TL3 regions are part of the same FUA. To improve time series, TL3 missing values have been estimated based on the evolution at higher geographic level.</p>

Over this period labour productivity in the upper half of regions grew roughly by 57%, 38 percentage points less than in the lower half of regions. During 2020, the gap widened again. Nevertheless, more years of data are necessary to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labour productivity gaps in regions.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A region is in the “upper half” if labour productivity was above the country median in the first year with available data and “lower half” if productivity was below the country median. Labour productivity in each group is equal to the sum of Gross Value Added, expressed in USD at constant prices and PPP (base year 2015) within the group, divided by the sum of total employment in regions within the group. Regions are small (TL3) regions, except for Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States where they are large (TL2) regions due to data availability.</p>

<p>Regions where the economic activity shifts towards tradable activities, such as industry and tradable services, tend to grow faster in terms of labour productivity. In Estonia, between 2001 and 2020, the share of workers in the industrial sector went down in all regions but more so in regions that were already in the lower half of the labour productivity distribution. At the same time, the share of workers in the tradable services sector went up in regions already located in the upper half of the labour productivity distribution while it went down in regions located in the lower half. Hence, the evolution of employment shares both in the industrial and in the tradable services sectors widened the labour productivity gap between regions.</p>

<div class="cell-output-display">
<p>The number of national-level strategic policy documents was reduced and there is no regional policy strategy in place since 2021. Instead, <em>a Regional Development Action Plan</em> (RDAP) was prepared and identifies the most eminent regional socio-economic inequalities which are considered major challenges/ of regional development in Estonia and sets a 4-year action plan covering different sectoral policy activities to address these challenges and support more balanced regional development in the country. Furthermore, the goals of regional balance in the country's strategic development goals are set in the <em>strategy "Estonia 2035"</em> (approved in 2021), which is also further addressed by the country's sectoral development plans.</p> <p>Estonia recently started preparing <em>a</em> <em>new national spatial</em> plan, which is scheduled to be finalised by 2026, replacing the current national spatial plan “Estonia 2030”.</p> <p>New <em>regional development support measures</em> have been prepared for the EU Cohesion Policy funds in 2021-27 (around 220 million of euros in total). These measures aim to support balanced territorial development and competitiveness in regions and cities. New specific support measures have also been launched in recent years for regions with the biggest development challenges under the Ida-Virumaa and South-East Estonia programs.</p> <p>A special <em>territorial transition plan for North-Eastern Estonia</em> was endorsed by the European Commission in 2022 and plans for various grant schemes and other support activities to promote the economic and labour market restructuring (around 80% of funding) and social and living environment transition processes (around 20% of funding) in this area. The plan will be funded by the EU Just Transition Fund (340 million euros), i.e., around 2500 euros per inhabitant. North-Eastern Estonia is an area of oil-shale energy production and other carbon-intensive industries that has contributed to the largest share of Estonian carbon emissions and is thereby also most remarkably influenced by decarbonisation processes and transition towards green and carbon-neutral economy and energy production.</p> <p>The national Government has assigned sectorial ministries <em>to take the regional development challenges and impacts into account when designing foreign aid support measures</em> funded by the EU funds of 2021-2027 and to plan concrete solutions to strengthen their compliance with the balanced territorial development target and a special <em>guideline</em> was prepared to support this process.</p> <p>To strengthen the fiscal capacity of local governments, the income tax allocated to local governments was increased by 0.3% (about 34 million euros more in each financial year in 2021 prices) and the equalisation fund added another 25 million euros. In total, the revenue of local governments from the income tax and equalisation fund increased by 4.2% in 2021.</p> <p>The national government supported local governments in times of crises. During the COVID-19 crisis (2020-21), local governments received 176 million euros of additional dedicated support. In 2022, 2.5 million euros were allocated to local governments for providing emergency assistance to the Ukrainian war refugees and about 80 million for the provision of services.</p> <p>In 2022, Estonia launched <em>regional development agreements/’deals’ for the pilot areas of Central- and South-Easter Estonia</em> in parallel with <em>setting up regional councils</em> mandated to coordinate their elaboration and implementation. The regional agreements are anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in regions larger than a county.</p> <section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <hr> <ol> <li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>In Estonia there is one tier of local governance system. Counties are not municipal administrative units as such, but territories where local governments jointly plan and implement development activities of broader regional importance and manage some public services (public transport for instance).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li> </ol> </section>
