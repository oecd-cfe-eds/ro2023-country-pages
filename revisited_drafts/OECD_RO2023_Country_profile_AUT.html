<td><p>The continued application of Cohesion policy funds strengthens action to promote economic development, well-being, environmental sustainability and resilience in all regions through ERDF and ESF. Supporting European objectives, the national programmes to use these funds address structural challenges, aspects of circular economy, enhancing inclusive and just society, by strengthening multi-level governance arrangements and coordination. As the national priority is on the Rural Development Programme the measures for non-agricultural activities, diversification and value chain integration, and ecological performance are of particular relevance for regional development.</p>
<p>Future orientations include:</p>
<p>• Make use of complementarities between the different policy instruments and funds, exploiting specific characteristics to enhance innovation, well-being and adapted climate action;</p>
<p>• aim at sustainable growth to decouple economic development from natural resource use increase;</p>
<p>• enhance territorial cooperation at fine geographical level and for trans-national cooperation, to mitigate development obstacles due to fragmentation of small scales (municipality and regional levels).</p></td>

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement between the EU Commission and Austria, adopted on 2 May 2022, sets out investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 to promote national cohesion and sustainable development. It foresees an amount of 1.3 bio € of Structural Funds support for Austrian programmes which will be co-financed by about 1.8 bio. € of national funds. Specific criteria to enhance an innovative and energy sufficient Austria are principles of circular economy, digitalisation and energy efficiency for selection of projects. Moreover, through the Just Transition Fund the country's transition to a climate-neutral economy through diversification of companies and start-ups to climate neutral and resource efficient activities that provide alternative jobs to replace those in energy intensive industries presently relying on fossil fuels as energy sources will be supported. The European Social Fund will support investments in infrastructures, jobs and education for persons with disabilities, people with migrant backgrounds and other disadvantaged groups. At the local scale, for support of life in cities and rural areas, projects on resource efficiency, climate adaptation, an innovation-oriented economy and local development will be supported. These activities continue on-going activities of several selected regions.</p>
<p>On the basis of the long-term strategy document, “ÖREK 2030”, a reorientation in priorities of regional development objectives has started recently and will be implemented over the next years. This includes in particular action on sparing use of land resources throughout the country, and climate action to achieve efficient and resilient resource use objectives. A series of national coordination and strategic planning activities will be implemented. So far, a land use development strategy to reduce the future land consumption and the high level of soil sealing by 2030 has been initiated. The second strategic working group (“Space for building culture”) aims at enhancing the societal role of architectural culture and heritage, in particular to strengthen town and city centres for shaping sustainable and resource efficient options of future spatial development.</p>
<p>Due to the specific relevance of landscapes for Austria’s regions, the renewed tourism strategy sets out a vision for this sector, particularly in relation to regional development options. The so-called “Plan T” sets the vision for sustainable tourism development.</p>
