<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>Given the country’s vast geography, regionalism has always been part of the political and social landscape of Canada. Nation-wide approaches to economic development do not fully address the differing regional circumstances. As such, Canada takes a place-based approach to economic development with responsibilities across different orders of government and across a range of departments, ministries and agencies, including the federal government’s seven regional development agencies. Federal regional economic development programs are complementary to national programming. In addition, Canada’s provinces and territories play an important role in economic development with exclusive responsibilities over an array of matters within their jurisdictions. There are several complementary economic development initiatives offered by federal, provincial and territorial governments. It is not possible to capture all initiatives within the scope of this document. Provinces and territories also have shared responsibilities with the federal government in areas such as old age pensions, agriculture, and immigration.</p>
<p>Rural and remote communities are crucial to the economic success of Canada, contributing about 25 percent of the country's GDP in 2019. In 2019, Canada introduced the first federal Minister of Rural Economic Development to pursue and advance initiatives that recognize the unique realities and challenges faced by rural communities, including measures to support economic recovery, growth and resilience. Key among these measures is providing access to fast and reliable high-speed Internet. As a result of the Universal Broadband Fund and other federal and provincial investments, Canada is on track to meet its goal of providing high-speed Internet access to 98 percent of Canadian households by 2026 and 100 percent by 2030. Additionally, the Minister of Rural Economic Development is mandated to support more visible and accessible service delivery in areas such as rural transit solutions, postal services, mental health services, and housing. To support the Minister in her mandate, <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/rural/en/centre-rural-economic-development">the Centre for Rural Economic Development (CenRED)</a> was established to help integrate rural needs and realities into the policy development process at the federal level by engaging across government and with rural communities and experts. Canada’s Rural Economic Development Strategy, entitled <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/rural/sites/default/files/documents/2022-03/rural-strat-august-2021-aout-eng.pdf"><em>Rural Opportunity, National Prosperity</em></a> was released in June 2019, outlining the whole-of-government approach that the Government of Canada is taking to meet the economic, social development, and sustainability needs of rural Canada. The progress report, released in August 2021, outlines progress made and next steps to ensure that Canada’s rural and remote communities are resilient and have access to tools necessary to reach their full economic potential.</p>
<p>Canada’s seven <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/canadas-regional-development-agencies">Regional Development Agencies</a> (RDAs) were created by the federal government to address key economic challenges by providing regionally tailored programs, services, knowledge and expertise. Each agency brings a regional policy perspective in support of the national agenda by contributing regional economic intelligence to support national decision-making; providing targeted investments to local businesses, organizations, and communities; and, contributing to cooperative relationships with other levels of government, community and post-secondary institutions, and other stakeholders. In 2021, the Government of Canada separated the former Western Economic Diversification Canada into two distinct RDAs, Pacific Economic Development Canada (PacifiCan) for the province of British Columbia, and Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) for the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. This decision recognized that economic drivers and conditions are unique in the different regions, and that entrepreneurs, innovators, institutions, and communities need access to place-based support.</p>
<p>RDAs took action to support business and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, they provided immediate liquidity support for businesses through the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/about-us/our-organization/canadas-regional-development-agencies/regional-relief-and-recovery-fund-rrrf">Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF)</a>. They then provided targeted programs such as the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/about-us/our-organization/canadas-regional-development-agencies/regional-relief-and-recovery-fund-rrrf/jobs-and-growth-fund">Jobs and Growth Fund (JGF)</a> to help job creators and the organizations that support them build resiliency and prepare for growth, the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/about-us/our-organization/canadas-regional-development-agencies/regional-relief-and-recovery-fund-rrrf/canada-community-revitalization-fund">Canada Community Revitalization Fund (CCRF)</a> to support local community infrastructure rejuvenation and development, and <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/about-us/our-organization/canadas-regional-development-agencies/regional-relief-and-recovery-fund-rrrf/tourism-relief-fund">Tourism Relief Fund (TRF)</a> to help tourism operators safely welcome back visitors after the pandemic by adjusting their operations to meet public health guidance and increase accessibility.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the Government of Canada is prioritizing investment to build a cleaner and green economy. RDAs have an important role to play in achieving this objective. For example, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) is accelerating small and medium sized enterprises’ <a href="https://ced.canada.ca/en/about-ced/accelerating-the-green-transition/?_ga=2.32255614.1163195693.1674656266-1737592913.1652794595&amp;_gl=1*iqtpb4*_ga*MTczNzU5MjkxMy4xNjUyNzk0NTk1*_ga_Q2F69KPVZ5*MTY3NDgzNDMwNC4zOC4xLjE2NzQ4MzQzMjIuMC4wLjA.">green transition</a>, helping Canada to reach its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In addition, Prairies Economic Development Canada is leading work under the Building a Green Prairie Economy Act to enhance federal, regional, and local cooperation on initiatives that support regional economic growth and the creation of sustainable, well-paying jobs across the prairie provinces.” As part of the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en">Innovation and Skills Plan</a>, RDAs have made investments in clean technology projects, supporting innovative start-ups to commercialize clean technology while creating sustainable local jobs.</p>
<p>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms the human rights of Indigenous Peoples. On June 21st, 2021, <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/U-2.2/"><em>the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (UNDRIP)</em></a> received Royal Assent and came into force. This Act provides a roadmap for the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples to work together to implement the Declaration based on lasting reconciliation, healing, and cooperative relations. At a regional level, Canada’s RDAs support and work in partnership with Indigenous peoples.</p>
