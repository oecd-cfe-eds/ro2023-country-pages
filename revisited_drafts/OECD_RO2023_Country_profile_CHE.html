<td>Objectives of regional policy</td>
<td>The federal government and the cantons created the Swiss regional policy to support Switzerland's mountain regions, other rural regions, and border regions in dealing with their structural changes. This economic development program promotes projects, initiatives, and programs that improve the economic framework conditions for entrepreneurial activities and sustainably enhance innovation capacity, value creation, and, thus, competitiveness. In this way, the Swiss regional policy contributes to creating and preserving jobs in the regions concerned. Indirectly, it contributes to the decentralized use of the territory and the reduction of regional disparities.</td>

<td>Approximately CHF 320 million are available to regional development for the years 2016 to 2023. On the fiscal equalization mechanisms, we possess the National fiscal equalization. Federalism is one of Switzerland’s fundamental principles. The 26 cantons and 2,148 communes have extensive powers. Fiscal equalization is thus also important for the unity of the country. It is based on the principle of solidarity: the economically strong cantons and the Confederation help out the economically weaker cantons.</td>

As a cross-cutting policy, AggloPol also provides a framework of objectives and actions for implementing and coordinating the various sectoral policies in urban areas.</td>

<p>Narrow Sense: With the program 2024-2017, the future orientations of the NRP will enter its third eight-year period (2024-2031). The former priority themes of "Industry / Innovation" and "Tourism" will be maintained. Smaller infrastructures can now be supported under certain conditions with non-repayable contributions. In addition to "local economy," which complements the export-oriented approach of NPR, sustainability, and digitalization will be particularly important cross-cutting themes.</p></td>

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Confederation's multi-year program 2024-2027 defines the following priorities:</p>
<p><em>Industry:</em> Innovative products and companies are an important factor in Switzerland's prosperity. The NPR supports innovation in SMEs at the business-to-business level in rural areas, mountain regions, and border regions. This support is provided mainly through the six "Regional innovation systems" (RIS), which promote competitiveness and innovation capacity, help for access to technological innovation and innovation that goes beyond technological innovation, offer support and coordinated services in the areas of information, advice, networking, infrastructure, and financing.</p>
<p><em>Tourism:</em> Tourism is vital to the regional economy, especially in mountain regions. The NPR encourages the development of new tourism offers and innovative products in this field. It also promotes collaborative projects between destinations and participates in financing tourism infrastructures that increase value creation in the region.</p>
<p><em>Digitalisation:</em> Digitalisation affects all areas of the economy. NPR supports and promotes digitalisation projects within its scope of impact. It also invests in awareness-raising and networking measures to prevent regions from being left behind in the digital age.</p>
<p>In addition to these priorities mentioned above, for the period 2024-2027, sustainability and social innovation will become central. As a result, projects in these areas will be fostered.</p>
