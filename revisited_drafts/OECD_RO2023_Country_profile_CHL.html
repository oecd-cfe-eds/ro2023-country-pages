<p>Within this framework, activities have been carried out with the Association of Regional Governors of Chile (AGORECHI) with whom an agreement was signed in January 2023 to advance in distributing power to the regions, particularly in matters of Interlevel Coordination and territorial participation, Administrative Decentralization, Fiscal Decentralization and the Formulation of a National Decentralization Policy. All this with the aim of providing public policies and programs more consistent with the needs of each region, closing territorial gaps, and deepening democracy and the proximity of citizens to decision-making.</p>
<p>As stated in said protocol, the Government is working on drawing up a National Decentralization Policy that develops some of these agreements, in accordance with certain guiding principles that the parties have agreed upon.</p>
<p>The aforementioned policy then proposes to address measures aimed at strengthening the Chilean decentralization process in a period of 10 to 12 years. Said policy is expected to indicate a distribution of powers, both interlevel and intersectoral, and establish the bases for effective administrative coordination.</p>
<p>Likewise, the administration is engaged in the elaboration of a Regional and Municipal Revenue Bill that will mean a substantial advance in terms of fiscal decentralization.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that work is being done on a redesign of the Ministry of the Interior, which will surely generate relevant changes related to the representation of the President of the Republic in subnational territories, in the context of a Unitary State.</p></td>

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>From 2018 onwards, by virtue of the transformations established by Laws 20,990, 21,073, 21,074 and 21,396, Chile makes substantial progress in political and administrative decentralization at the regional level. Giving rise to the popular election of the Regional Governor, executive body of the Regional Government; expanding the powers and functions of its collegiate body, the Regional Council; strengthening its administrative structure by creating new divisions for productive development and industry, social and human development, and infrastructure and transportation, and establishing a new institutional framework and regulations to strengthen decentralization through the transfer of powers.</p>
<p>In a transition period through transitory article 5, of Law No. 21,074, on Strengthening the Regionalization of the Country, the President of the Republic exercised the power given to individualize 15 powers to transfer to Regional Governments, from the ministries of Housing and Urban Development (MINVU), Transport and Telecommunications (MTT); in the Corporation for the Promotion of Production (CORFO); in the Technical Cooperation Service (SERCOTEC); and in the Solidarity and Social Investment Fund (FOSIS)”. These were transferred through their respective supreme decrees, temporarily.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of his administration, the government of President Gabriel Boric promotes the Forum for Decentralization, as a collaborative instance of permanent work with the Governors and Governors, favoring political-technical dialogue that allows in the short term to advance towards an effectively decentralized Chile. . The purpose of this instance is to agree on a common roadmap regarding the process of transferring powers. Specifically, identify a set of prioritized and agreed powers, which will be presented to the President of the Republic and officiated at the Inter-ministerial Decentralization Committee, to be submitted for evaluation and eventually transferred.</p>
<p>Likewise, taking into account the priority assigned to decentralization as one of the four axes of the government program, the executive considers the elaboration of a National Decentralization Policy that marks the orientations and commitments for the coming years, the presentation of a draft Regional Income Law, and the strengthening of local finances</p>
