<p><strong>Recent policy developments</strong></p>
<p>One of the main and recent policy development in Costa Rica is the approval of the Regional Development Law No. 10.096, which brings a twist to managing development because of its emphasis on subnational areas, particularly on the planning regions. This law reinforces the Regional Planning Subsystem and provides new tools for addressing internal and external regional development gaps. Some of these tools are the Regional Development Fund, the regional budgets, the regional GDP index, the Regional Development Observatory, the National Regional Development Policy, the Study to update the regionalisation scheme of the country, the Regional Development Agencies and its coordination mechanisms between national and regional levels. Furthermore, the law establishes the concept, objective and axes for regional development in Costa Rica, as well as provisions for development planning and budgeting, considering the regional level.</p>
<p>Finally two additional initiatives contribute to regional development. The first is the National Clusters Program, led by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MTSS), which focuses on facilitating collaboration to improve productivity, competitiveness, innovation, linkages and employment at the national and territorial levels. The second initiative is the Law to Strengthen Territorial Competitiveness to Promote the Attraction of Investments Outside the Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM), No. 10234, led by the Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE).</p>
