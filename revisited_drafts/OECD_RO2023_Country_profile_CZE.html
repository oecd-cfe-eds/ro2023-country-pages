<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Czech regional policy relies on EU structural funds investments. Additional resources, though minimal in comparison, come from other budgetary sources. The regional policy is guided by the “Regional Development Strategy 21+”, which was approved by the government in late 2019. To guide the management of structure funds, a special document called “Territorial dimension of operational programmes”, approved by the government, stipulates compulsory regional investments, especially in the area of integrated tools (Integrated Territorial Investment and Community-led Local Development).</p>
<p>The government has made regional policy a key priority of its agenda and has set out some new directions, including to incorporate territorial impact assessment in legislation procedures and to establish a new initiative called “Government committee on regional policy”, which should strengthen the Ministry for Regional Development vis-a-vis other line ministries so as to enforce regional policy interests across all government investments and other activities.</p>
