<p><em>Reform of the Joint Federal/Länder Task for the Improvement of Regional Economic Structures (GRW):</em> The Joint Federal/Länder Task for the Improvement of Regional Economic Structures (GRW) serves as the backbone of regional structural policy in Germany and addresses structurally weak regions. The Joint Task offers a broad range of funding instruments for private and public investment and strategies that regions can use to meet their specific needs. It is based on the cooperation between the Federation and the Länder anchored in the German Constitution and was established more than five decades ago. In view of changed global and local challenges, the Federation and the Länder have adopted a major reform of the Coordination Framework of the Joint Task which serves as the basis for the respective Länder funding guidelines on 13 December 2022.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, the expertise of representatives from academia and from companies, associations, trade unions, municipalities and other interested organisations was taken on board. The scope of the reform is large. Main changes include an extension of the objectives of the programme: So far, the focus was on securing and creating jobs. Now, three main objectives are pursued: (1) creating and safeguarding jobs, boosting growth and prosperity; (2) offsetting disadvantages affecting commercial activity; (3) accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral and sustainable economy. In line with this, the reform enables better support for green investments both in terms of eligible projects and funding intensity. Also, the reform leads to a better recognition of local value chains: It is not decisive any longer, whether firms operate primarily locally or transregionally; instead, investment projects are eligible for funding, if they make a significant contribution to attaining the programme objectives. Another major change is the introduction of support for regional services of general interest in order to strengthen regional attractiveness for firms and employees. With respect to infrastructure investments, more effort is placed on regional development concepts in order to stimulate an integrated regional development. Following on the reform of the Joint Task, the federal government will continue to further develop regional policy in Germany.</p>
<p><em>EU structural funds:</em> The German Partnership Agreement and the programmes for the EU structural funds for the funding period 2021-2027 have been adopted in 2022 and implementation gathers pace. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is focused on innovation, digitization and economic transformation (56% of the budget). Investments target the competitiveness of SME, knowledge and technology transfer and the improvement of public and private research infrastructure. In comparison to the last funding period the importance of climate and environmental goals in the ERDF further increased (34% of the funding). Investments target energy efficient production processes and renovation of public buildings, adaptation to climate change, risk management and disaster prevention including nature-based solutions. The new Just Transition Fund supports coal regions in four German federal states with additional means to master structural change. The investments of the European Social Fund Plus target skill development and social inclusion.</p>
<p><em>Structural Strengthening Act</em>: The Structural Strengthening Act has been introduced in 2020 to provide financial support to the regions most affected by the coal phase-out. Until the end of 2022 the federal government has approved projects of the Länder totaling 6.4 bn EUR. The majority of funds are allocated to projects related to improving locations for businesses, research and development as well as education. The Bund-Länder Coordination Body has approved 107 projects of the federal government totaling up to 19.5 bn EUR. This includes R&amp;D projects and institutions, transport infrastructure and the relocation of federal agencies (4415 full time-equivalents have been planned so far). The first evaluation of the Structural Strengthening Act is ongoing and will be published in June.</p>
