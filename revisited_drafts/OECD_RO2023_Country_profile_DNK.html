<p>Each of the five regions formulate a regional development strategy every 3-4 years. There is no national strategic document although it has been a clear political priority of the government to ensure balanced regional development in recent years.</p>
<p>As part of a wider reform of the public sector administration, nine municipalities (number extended later) took part in a policy experiment called the “Free Municipality” initiative.

<td>Urban policy framework</td>

National focus has, first of all, been directed towards improving the regional cohesion and balance through infrastructure developments, decentralization of public institutions and through business development.</p>
<p>Secondly, on town level, attention has been on the access to private and public services such as shops, schools and health facilities. Inspired by a place-based development framework the government has encouraged municipalities to strengthen private-public partnerships and to identify place-based qualities and strategies. Two examples of such policy tools are the urban renewal scheme and the “Partnership for thriving town centers” (2020-2022).</p></td>

<p>In 2019, the Danish government issued the Business Promotion Act with the purpose of improving the conditions for business owners, enhancing productivity and export and avoid overlapping regional development and business promotion initiatives.</p>
<p>The responsibility of business promotion was transferred from the regions to national level (Danish Board of Business Development) in 2019.

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>In 2020, the national government implemented an equalisation reform at the municipal level evening out the revenues of the municipalities based on each muncipality's expenditure level.</p>
<p>In 2022, the national government, along with the majority of the other elected parties, agreed on a reform with the purpose of making it possible to obtain higher education in all parts of the country, rather than just in the major cities.</p>
<p>A property tax reform was approved in 2017 and became fully effective in 2021. The reform included new valuations of property to reflect the property market values more accurately, thereby ending the property valuation freeze in place since 2002, which has led to falling effective tax rates for homes experiencing increase in value.</p>
