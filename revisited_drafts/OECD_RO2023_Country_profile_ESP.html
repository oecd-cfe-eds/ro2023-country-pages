<td>Key regional development challenges</td>
<td><p>Spanish population continues to grow, while it tends to concentrate in large urban areas, resulting in a deeper territorial imbalance. As a result, around 90% of the population is spread over 30% of the land. Also, as Eurostat data shows, the population density in Spain in 2019 stood at 93.8 people per square kilometer, below the EU average of 109 inhab./km2 . Moreover, based on municipal organization data, municipalities with 5,000 or fewer inhabitants represent (as of January 1, 2021) 83.9% of the total, although they host about 5.69 million people, or 12% of the total Spanish population. At the same time, a significant number of municipalities with between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants also present worrying patterns of depopulation and ageing population. Specifically, on January 1, 2021, from the 899 municipalities between 5,001 and 20,000 inhabitants, 36% have lost population in the period 2016-2021 and in more than a third of these locations (35%), at least 20% of the population is over 65 years old.</p>
<p>Spain has the longest life expectancy in the EU, with 20% of the population aged 65+ and 1/3 of this share is 80+.</p>
<p>In rural areas and intermediate cities, the proportion of older people is higher (38-48% for rural areas, and 31% of the total population for intermediate regions). Also, the effect of tourism increases the disparities, due to the floating population effect and large seasonal population increases, mostly concentrated in highly densely populated coastal areas where land use pressure and cost is intensified.</p>
<p>In addition, depopulated areas suffer from higher masculization ratios, young brain drain loss, salary and digital gaps, smaller sized companies which, among other factors, typically result in lower productivity and innovation rates compared to urban areas.</p></td>
