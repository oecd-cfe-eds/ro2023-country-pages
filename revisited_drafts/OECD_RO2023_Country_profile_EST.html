<td>Key regional development challenges</td>
<td><p>• Large regional disparities in socio-economic development, despite the small size of the country (for example in GDP, business performance indicators, demographic trends, incomes in particular). There has been no significant trend towards territorially more balanced development in recent years also.</p>
<p>• More active economic activity and attractive/profitable jobs are concentrating in larger urban regions, and regional differences in economic growth are deepening.</p>
<p>• Demographic changes, especially internal migration of younger people towards largest urban areas are generating regional shrinkage outside major urban areas and is weakening the development prospects of these shrinking regions.</p>
<p>• Local governance, investment and development capacity (e.g in delivery of quality public services) is still uneven across municipalities. Municipalities in larger urban areas with more favourable demographic structure have normally higher and remote, sparsely populated municipalities located further away from cities lower capacity.</p>
<p>• There are still shortcomings in the coordination of the regional impact of sectoral policies in the goals of balanced regional development.</p></td>

<p>• Promoting financial autonomy of local municipalities and reducing the political dependency from the central government when it comes to the formation of their tax base;</p>
<p>•Transferring some complementary state government responsibilities/functions to local municipalities and increasing decentralisation in public governance, along with ensuring the necessary revenue base;</p>

The Ministry is also in charge of the issues of territorial administration and setting financial management principles for local authorities. The Ministry also designs and coordinates the implementation of regional development (e.g. rural and urban areas) grant schemes and development of regional public transport.</p>
<p>The other ministries also contribute to development of regions and cities by coordinating specific sectorial policies having a stronger territorial relevance:</p>

This calculation does not include the other sectorial policy grants reaching also to different regions of Estonia.</p>
<p>The fiscal equalisation mechanism forms 107,4 million euros (2023), which represents 3,6% of total local government income.</p></td>

<td>National regional development policy framework</td>
<td><p>Since 2021 we have no longer had a holistic national regional development strategy being valid for all sectorial ministries. Nevertheless, regional development goals, e.g to ensure a more balanced territorial development and consideration of different territorial needs through sectorial policy strategies is set within the National Development Strategy “Estonia 2035”.</p>
<p>There is also a new Regional Development Action Plan (RDAP) in place since 2022. The RPAP defines the most eminent socio-economic inequalities of regional development seen as major challenges/root-problems of regional development in Estonia, and creates a framework for monitoring these processes. It also sets more detailed 4-year action plan covering different sectorial policy activities to alleviate these root problems and support more even regional development.</p>
<p>Besides, there is a regional development program for 4-year period (being updated annual-basis), which sets up the implementation plan for the ministry responsible for regional policy in Estonia (Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture). This document is also a basis for planning 4-years state budget strategy.</p>
<p>At regional level there are 15 county<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> development strategies in place, developed jointly by the local municipalities of the county. Although there is a general requirement that the county development strategies and national level policy strategies are consistent and consider each other’s priorities, there are no binding mechanisms to ensure this in practice.</p>
<p>There is no official regional policy council or advisory group or other such institution currently in Estonia at government level coordinating the development and implementation of regional policy across sectorial ministries and levels of governance.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Urban policy framework</td>
<td><p>Estonia does not have an explicit national urban policy or national strategy for urban development. The urban development issues have addressed within a broader national regional policy framework.</p>
<p>E.g. specific grant schemes for development of 5 largest urban areas of Estonia are applied being funded from the European Regional Development Fund of 2021-27. These grant schemes aim to support investments in innovative digital solutions and green infrastructure of Estonian largest urban areas and revitalization of the largest urban areas in North-Eastern Estonia.</p>
<p>One soft coordination initiative is a national network of urban development specialists. This is an informal multilevel governance and collaboration platform, assembling officials of urban municipalities in charge or strategic development and spatial planning of their cities/towns and the Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities.

The ministry e.g. coordinates Estonia’s rural development policy, implements the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy for Estonia and develops/implements the Estonian strategic Rural Development Plans.</p>
<p>Rural development is also an integral part of the national regional policy and its incentives. The Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture is in charge of designing and implementing territorial development policies which is largely addressed to specificities and challenges of rural areas.</p>

Both documents bring together incentives of different ministries/sectoral policies for development of these regions and include only activities initiated by the central government.</p>
<p>• As a new initiative, the Ministry of Regional Affairs and Agriculture is piloting regional development agreements/’deals’ in parallel with setting up regional councils mandated for coordination of their further elaboration and implementation, starting with the pilot areas of Central- and South-Estonia. The regional agreements will be anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in region larger than a county.</p></td>

These indicators have been set in accordance with the strategic objectives of the „Estonia 2035“ strategy and their monitoring indicators at national level. Thereby monitoring the implementation of the Regional Development Action Plan simultaneously enables to assess also how the goals of the national development strategy are reached in territorial dimension.</p>

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The number of national-level strategic policy documents was reduced and there is no regional policy strategy in place since 2021. Instead, <em>a Regional Development Action Plan</em> (RDAP) was prepared and identifies the most eminent regional socio-economic inequalities which are considered major challenges/ of regional development in Estonia and sets a 4-year action plan covering different sectoral policy activities to address these challenges and support more balanced regional development in the country. Furthermore, the goals of regional balance in the country's strategic development goals are set in the <em>strategy "Estonia 2035"</em> (approved in 2021), which is also further addressed by the country's sectoral development plans.</p>
<p>Estonia recently started preparing <em>a</em> <em>new national spatial</em> plan, which is scheduled to be finalised by 2026, replacing the current national spatial plan “Estonia 2030”.</p>
<p>New <em>regional development support measures</em> have been prepared for the EU Cohesion Policy funds in 2021-27 (around 220 million of euros in total). These measures aim to support balanced territorial development and competitiveness in regions and cities. New specific support measures have also been launched in recent years for regions with the biggest development challenges under the Ida-Virumaa and South-East Estonia programs.</p>
<p>A special <em>territorial transition plan for North-Eastern Estonia</em> was endorsed by the European Commission in 2022 and plans for various grant schemes and other support activities to promote the economic and labour market restructuring (around 80% of funding) and social and living environment transition processes (around 20% of funding) in this area. The plan will be funded by the EU Just Transition Fund (340 million euros), i.e., around 2500 euros per inhabitant. North-Eastern Estonia is an area of oil-shale energy production and other carbon-intensive industries that has contributed to the largest share of Estonian carbon emissions and is thereby also most remarkably influenced by decarbonisation processes and transition towards green and carbon-neutral economy and energy production.</p>
<p>The national Government has assigned sectorial ministries <em>to take the regional development challenges and impacts into account when designing foreign aid support measures</em> funded by the EU funds of 2021-2027 and to plan concrete solutions to strengthen their compliance with the balanced territorial development target and a special <em>guideline</em> was prepared to support this process.</p>
<p>To strengthen the fiscal capacity of local governments, the income tax allocated to local governments was increased by 0.3% (about 34 million euros more in each financial year in 2021 prices) and the equalisation fund added another 25 million euros. In total, the revenue of local governments from the income tax and equalisation fund increased by 4.2% in 2021.</p>
<p>The national government supported local governments in times of crises. During the COVID-19 crisis (2020-21), local governments received 176 million euros of additional dedicated support. In 2022, 2.5 million euros were allocated to local governments for providing emergency assistance to the Ukrainian war refugees and about 80 million for the provision of services.</p>
<p>In 2022, Estonia launched <em>regional development agreements/’deals’ for the pilot areas of Central- and South-Easter Estonia</em> in parallel with <em>setting up regional councils</em> mandated to coordinate their elaboration and implementation. The regional agreements are anticipated to become agreements between central and local governments and other regional stakeholders on the objectives, key economic sectors and activities and financing for increasing regional economic competitiveness in regions larger than a county.</p>
