<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>Legislation on regional development and the European Union’s regional and structural policy was reformed and entered into force in the autumn of 2021. According to the law, the government and regional organisations must regularly discuss the regional development objectives and their implementations. The discussions are based on the regional development decision, regional programmes and the situational picture of regional development.</p>
<p>The state concluded ecosystem agreements with 16 urban areas to strengthen innovation activities. The objective of the agreements is to build innovation ecosystems, in other words, to intensify cooperation within networks, strengthen key competences and increase effectiveness of R&amp;D&amp;I activities. The ecosystem agreements were signed in February 2021. Implementation of the agreements will take place with the resources for sustainable urban development in the EU programming period 2021–2027.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of regional development is strengthened through cooperation between regions. The state supports regional cooperation by financing regional development theme networks and development zones in 2021-2023.</p>
<p>The economic effects of Russia´s war of aggression against Ukraine have been significant in Finland and especially in eastern parts of the country. During the summer of 2022, a working group of State Secretaries worked out measures to strengthen the vitality of eastern Finland. One of the recommendations was that a common development vision must be created for eastern Finland in close cooperation between companies, the state, and the regions. The vision will be published in February 2023.</p>
<p>In 2022, a funding tool for supporting R&amp;D&amp;I activities in regions was introduced. The aim is to support R&amp;D activities of companies in different parts of Finland and strengthen the regional innovation policy.</p>
<p>Responsibility for organising social and health services and rescue operations was transferred from municipalities and municipal associations to 21 self-governing well-being services counties on the 1 January 2023. The objective of the reform, that created a new administrative level, was to improve the availability and quality of basic public services throughout Finland.</p>
