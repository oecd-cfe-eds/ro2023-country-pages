<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>There is no explicit regional development policy framework since the Regional Development Agencies in England were closed in 2010. However, since 2011 the UK Government has shifted its focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships, of which there are currently 38, to bring together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England and deliver some government programmes including the Local Growth Fund, Getting Building Fund and programmes linked to skills development. The three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have responsibility for urban, regional and spatial planning policies in their areas, but the UK Government has established offices in all three territories to help deliver UK wide levelling-up programmes such as the Levelling Up Fund, UK Shared Prosperity Fund and Communities Opportunities Fund, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>With the launch of the Levelling Up White Paper in 2022, there has been an enhanced programme of spreading opportunity to all parts of the country and the three Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Since 2011, in England the government has shifted focus in England to functional economic areas by launching Local Enterprise Partnerships and has pursued a policy of devolving more power and resources to local and combined authorities such as Mayoral Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities.</p>
<p>Devolution is at the heart of the UK Government’s plans to increase economic growth and level up the whole country. The Government announced the biggest ever transfer of powers away from Westminster in the Levelling Up White Paper. It is committed to further extending devolution across England and seeing more empowered and accountable local leaders who can drive growth, innovate, and respond to the specific challenges and needs of their areas. Six new devolution deals were announced in 2022 to drive forward improved outcomes for over 7.2million people that live in those areas by directly electing a mayor/leader to represent them in the future. The six deals agreed in 2022 will bring devolution to over 52% of the English population, up from 41% in 2021. The new deals agreed in 2022 will see over £4bn invested in local areas over a period of 30 years. Once mayors are elected, these deals will give their mayors and leaders greater local control over things like transport, infrastructure and skills. Discussions with places to identify potential candidates for the next set of new devolution deals is well underway in 2023.</p>
<p>For over 11 years 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) have brought together businesses and local leaders to drive economic growth across England. They have also been responsible for the delivery of a number of funding streams that have provided support to businesses and invested in local infrastructure. Since publication of the Levelling Up White Paper, strong progress has been made on extending devolution across England. To this end, the UK Government intends for the functions of LEPs to be delivered by democratically elected local leaders where appropriate in the future, and where they are not already delivered by Combined Authorities. It is minded to withdraw core funding for LEPs from April 2024. To minimise any disruption for LEPs, the areas they support, and delivery of Government programmes the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and the Department for Business and Trade are consulting LEPs and other key stakeholders on this proposal. An eight-week information gathering exercise was launched on 17 March, before confirming a decision (consultation closes on 19 May). The Government will publish an updated policy position to confirm next steps by summer 2023.</p>
<p>The Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are largely responsible for regional economic development and spatial planning in their territories. The Welsh Government published “Future Wales - the National Plan 2040” in February 2021. This sets out the national development plan and spatial strategy for Wales. Scotland published a 4th update to its National Planning Framework in February 2023. This provides a national spatial strategy for Scotland setting out its spatial principles, regional priorities and national planning policy. Northern Ireland has a Regional Development Strategy 2035. This puts in place spatial planning, transport and housing priorities to support economic growth and regional prosperity.</p>
