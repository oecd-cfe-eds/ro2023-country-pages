<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>For Greece, the main financial Instruments are the Partnership Agreement 2021-2027 (PA) and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).</p>
<p>The Partnership Agreement between the EU Commission and Greece, adopted in June 2021, sets out the investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 in order to contribute to the regeneration of the Greek economy by restructuring and upgrading the productive and social fabric of the country and by creating and maintaining sustainable jobs through the outward-looking, innovative and competitive entrepreneurship and the support of the social cohesion and the principles of sustainable development. Over €26billion of EU funds and national co financing sustain the green and digital transition, while supporting the most fragile and vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>The Partnership Agreement is entirely in line with the National Growth Strategy, is complementary to the goals and targets of the Recovery and Resilience Programme and is consistent with the European Regulations and the National Sectoral Strategies. For the finalisation of the text, there was a broad consultation with stakeholders of all levels of governance and social partners, and subsequently it was submitted to EU.</p>
<p>With regard to the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), 4 are its directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increase of domestic productive base of the country</p></li>
<li><p>Decrease of social disparities,</p></li>
<li><p>Integrated public policies and</p></li>
<li><p>Empower of the multilevel governance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Greece’s RRF counts to an amount of 30,5 billion euros and consists of two strands the first being grants for an amount of 17,8 billion and the rest for loans and guarantees. A percentage of 38% of the loan strand addresses to the industrial sector.</p>
