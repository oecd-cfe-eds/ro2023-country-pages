<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>Since 2022, territorial development has gained prominence in the policy agenda, and accordingly, its tasks and powers evolved. As of May 2022, the Minister for Regional Development is a member of the government with unified development policy responsibilities.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for the EU Cohesion Policy programming period 2021-2027, the objectives of the National Development and Territorial Development Concept (NDTDC) and the national development priorities for the period post-2020 have been revised as well as the related sectoral and territorial development tasks. The ambition is to renew the regional development approach and planning environment in order to start the 2028-2034 EU budget period in a new planning and development ecosystem that can respond more quickly and efficiently to challenges and with a more explicit territorial approach. It is necessary to rethink the territorial objectives of the NDTDC, the development challenges of the country, and make the system of tools and institutions for territorial development suitable and resilient to manage new challenges.</p>
<p>As part of the preparation for the next programming period and in compliance with the plan renewal obligations laid down in the relevant legislation, the review of the territorial development concepts of the counties, the special functional areas and of the capital, and the elaboration of the related territorial development programmes were completed during 2020-2021. The planning documents were adopted by the county and capital assemblies.</p>
<p>Following negotiations with the European Commission and a social consultation, Hungary officially submitted the Partnership Agreement to the European Commission on 30 December 2021, which was adopted by the Commission in December 2022, together with the operational programmes. The Partnership Agreement lays down the developments on which the country will spend the cohesion funds coming to Hungary from the EU's multiannual financial framework (21.7 billion euros). The focus will continue to be on economic development, competitiveness, infrastructure development and job creation. Another essential element of this strategic document is that it states that, in order to facilitate catch-up, at least 65 percent of the resources must be used in the four most disadvantaged Hungarian regions.</p>
<p>A territorial operational program was prepared for the period 2021-2027, “Territorial and Settlement Development Operational Programme Plus” (TOP Plus). TOP Plus manages both place-based developments of the less-developed regions and Budapest being a developed region, using ERDF and ESF+ funds. The TOP Plus continues the 2014-2020 TOP themes and its model realised through integrated territorial programmes with a budget of €4.3 billion. It maintains the themes and tools of supporting local government developments, integrated county planning, the territorial selection procedure, and the active involvement of regional actors (county level local governments and the capital city local government) in planning and implementation. TOP Plus was adopted in December 2022.</p>
<p>The planning of the county and capital integrated territorial programmes (ITPs) took place in parallel to TOP Plus programming, based on the principles and budget framework of TOP Plus, and with the guidelines of the relevant sectoral ministries. This parallel planning method created the territorial legitimacy of TOP Plus. The preliminary ITPs were adopted by the Government in 2022, and their content will be finalised in the first semester of 2023.</p>
<p>A sustainable urban development strategy (SUD) is being prepared in 42 cities (among them 3 functional urban areas) selected in the county integrated territorial programmes and they are allocated 8% of the national ERDF framework and related ESF+ funds. The SUD has a complex approach and is in line with the city's integrated settlement development strategy. The indicative budget for the cities designated in the framework of the sustainable urban development tool is set in the 1658/2021. (IX. 24.) Government decision. The action plan developed by SUD for TOP+ resources is the TOP+ Urban Development Program Plan.</p>
