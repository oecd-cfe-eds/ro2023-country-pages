<p>The Icelandic Regional Development Institute (<em>Byggðastofnun</em>) was founded in 1985 and falls under <a href="https://www.byggdastofnun.is/static/files/Log_og_reglugerd/byggdastofnun-log-106-1999-enska-2014.pdf">Act. No 106 of December 27 1999</a> and <a href="https://www.byggdastofnun.is/static/files/Log_og_reglugerd/byggdastofnun-reglugerd-347-2000-enska-2014.pdf">Regulation No 347 of May 16 2000</a>. It is an independent state-owned institute and heres under the ultimate authority of the Minister of Infrastructure. The function of Byggðastofnun is to promote rural settlement and economic activity, with special emphasis on the creation of equal opportunities for all inhabitants to employment and habitation. In accordance with its function Byggðastofnun prepares, organizes and funds projects and provides loans with the aim of bolstering regional settlement, boosting employment and encouraging innovation in business and industry.</p>
<p>Byggðastofnun organizes and contributes to consultancy services in co-operation with economic development agencies, local authorities, and other interested parties.</p>
<p>Regional plans of action (RPA) are a joint project of national and local authorities.

The aim of the legislation is to support regional development and increase consultation in regional affairs between ministries, within each region and between administrative levels. The responsibility of local authorities in regional and community development would also be increased.</p>
<p>The eight regional associations of local authorities are responsible for implementing the initiatives of regional plans of Actions through five-year contracts with the government. The country is divided into eight regions.</p>
<p>The government’s steering group for regional development as defined in law supports the regional associations of local authorities in developing and executing regional initiatives. The role of the steering group includes increasing coordination within the government in matters pertaining to regional development and ensuring active consultation with the municipal level.

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Strategic Regional Plan (SRP) of Iceland 2022-2036 is an integrated social and economic development plan that provides a framework for regional support. Its main goals are to address depopulation in individual regions; address the lack of economic and industrial diversity; support technological changes and the development and adaption of individual industries; outline necessary adaption measures to counter the impacts of climate change; ensure smooth communications and access to services and respond to increasing competition for people and companies.</p>
<p>The following points are examples of challenges and opportunities that are addressed in a novel or more decisive way than in previous SRP’s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Existing knowledge on the effects of climate change, risk assessments and impacts on biological diversity are to be considered in all policy making, planning and decisions concerning the development of communities, land use and planning on land, sea and in coastal areas. In this regard a special action in the SRP has the objective … “to formulate a comprehensive approach to the adaptation of municipalities to the effects impacts of climate change.” This is in line with the emphasis of the Nordic Council of Ministers</p></li>
<li><p>Following a steep increase in number of immigrants an emphasis is on facilitating social diversity and demographic factors, such as gender, age and origin and the opportunities inherent in the human resources of each rural community are to be fully utilised. In that regard a special action will be implemented with the objective to increase awareness of the importance of equality and diversity within local governments by supporting their efforts to reflect the diversity of human society so that their decision making serves the needs and benefits the entire population while being in compliance with their gender equality plans.</p></li>
<li><p>In effort to boost the international competitiveness of the country for investments and human capital along with equalizing the access to jobs and services for the whole population a special focus is on the urban – rural linkage. For that purpose, a designated action is on the SRP with the aim to define the role of the two largest urban areas in the overall regional development of the country. The work will be executed in the OECD NUP framework as applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>The contemporary digital revolution has already weakened the ties between subsistence and residence in many occupations and that opens opportunities for more freedom of residence which is the aim of one the 44 actions of the SRP by increasing the number of location independent jobs to increase the variety of jobs in rural areas. The prospects of communities may thus increasingly be determined by factors such as natural amenities, spatial planning, the provision of services to children and the elderly, cultural and recreational opportunities, and beyond anything else a good and enjoyable social life.</p></li>
