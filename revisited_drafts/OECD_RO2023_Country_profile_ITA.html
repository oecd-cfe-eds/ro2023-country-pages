<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement between the EU Commission and Italy, adopted in July 2022, sets out investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 to promote national cohesion and sustainable development, with a particular focus on the Southern Regions. Around €75 billion of EU funds and national co-financing sustain the green and digital transition, while supporting the most fragile territories and vulnerable groups. To this aim, the Partnership Agreement promotes the implementation of policies that are tailored to the relevant territorial scales and effective multi-level governance to ensure a more even distribution of essential services and economic opportunities.</p>
<p>In particular, the Partnership Agreement continues to support the National Strategy for Inner Areas, to make them more resilient to natural risks, developing employment opportunities, improving the quality of services (education, healthcare, mobility), and promoting municipal associations in the territories involved. The National Programme for Metropolitan Cities and Southern medium-sized Cities 2021-2027 addresses the challenges of fighting climate change and socio-economic inequalities, re-generating marginal urban areas and supporting social innovation projects, public housing and the development of digital services. The Just Transition Fund (€1,2 billion of EU and national resources) supports the diversification of the economic activities currently based on carbon intensive industries in the areas of “Sulcis Iglesiente” in Sardinia and Taranto in Apulia.</p>
<p>Within Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement, the collaboration between the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Department of Cohesion Policy ensures the production of subnational statistics and indicators at the level of granularity needed to assess the contribution of policies in different places. In recent years, a significant investment has been made to expand the breadth and depth of data and indicators available for regions, cities and rural areas in many domains, including SDGs, well-being, environmental quality, business environment.</p>
<p>As concerns the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), one of its key objectives is to promote social and territorial cohesion. Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) allocates 40 per cent of investments with a territorial destination to the Southern Regions (around €82 billion out of a total of €206 billion). In particular, the Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport has allocated 55 per cent of its NRRP and complementary resources (€61,5 billion) to projects in the Southern regions (railway infrastructures, ports and logistics, sustainable urban mobilty, water infrastructures, public housing), in line with the objectives of territorial cohesion and inequality reduction. This threshold represents a relevant ambitious objective: under national public investment programmes, 34 per cent of capital resources are allocated to the South (in proportion to the resident population).</p>
<p>In general, the use of the RRF versus Cohesion Policy funds is guided by eligibility, national/regional competences, timing and investment scale. The Italian Government has put a significant investment in human resources within administrations at the centre of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, strengthening the capacities for effective management of public investment particularly at territorial level (including procurement processes, evaluation and project design, management of contracts and project delivery approaches).</p>
<p>The Infrastructural Equalisation Fund, “<em>Fondo perequativo infrastrutturale</em>” (€4,6 billion from 2022 to 2033) has the objective of rebalancing the infrastructural divide between different areas, with a particular focus on the Southern Regions.</p>
