<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>November 2021, Japanese PM Kishida set forth ”The Vision for a Digital Garden City Nation”, which aims to solve rural issues and improve rural attractiveness while utilizing strength of each region through digital technologies, and to realize a society where everyone can live conveniently and comfortably wherever they live in Japan. Under this vision, it is expected that the use of digital technology solves rural issues such as population decline, declining birth-rate and aging population, and hollowing out of regional industries for example by promoting remote work and relocation to rural areas, establishing satellite offices and implementing remote medicine, distance education, automated driving and drones. December 2022, the Japanese Government formulated the comprehensive strategy to realize this vision and will make a concerted effort to support the local governments in implementing measures to achieve their respective regional visions.</p>
