<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>In order to create a promotion system that connects and integrates the plans and tasks related to balanced development and decentralisation that have been individually promoted so far, the government of Korea is trying to enact the Special Act on Decentralisation of Local Autonomy and Balanced Regional Development, which would replace the existing Special Act on Balanced National Development. When the new law is enacted, the budget of special account for balanced national development will be converted into a special account for balanced regional development, and projects related to comprehensive plans and balanced regional development policies will be promoted.</p>
<p>Future orientations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transfer the authority of the central government to local governments for supporting growth engines with a comparative advantage on their own</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce Opportunity Development Zone (ODZ) to encourage investment in provincial urban areas. Various benefits including tax cuts will be provided to companies relocating to the area</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce special zones for free education to provide customised public education for each region. If designated as a special zone, administrative and financial support will be given to diversify public education, such as various alternative schools</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce special urban convergence zones to create a complex that combines industry, housing and culture with the aim of balanced regional development</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the Korean government intends to contribute to balanced national development by enacting the "Special Act on Supporting Depopulation Areas" to improve settlement conditions in depopulation areas and promote regional vitality. This special law establishes a comprehensive regional development and national-level regional support system for local governments to cope with the population decline crisis, and stipulates ways to promote linkages and cooperation between local governments, and special cases for population reduction areas. The Special Act on Supporting Depopulation Areas has been in effect since January 1, 2023, and is currently pursuing a policy to enhance regional vitality by investing 1 trillion KRW in 89 regions every year for 10 years.</p>
