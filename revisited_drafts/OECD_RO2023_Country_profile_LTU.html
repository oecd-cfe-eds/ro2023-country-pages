<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Government of Lithuania approved the Regional Development Programme for 2022-2030. Along with the Partnership Agreement on EU Funds for 2021-2027 and 2021-2027 EU Funds’ Investment programme, it created the strategic framework for Regional Development Councils to set the goals of regional cohesion and put them into Regional Development Plans. Bottom-up approach allows regions (Regional Development Councils) to make decisions, what and to what extent the identified social, economic, environmental, territorial problems within the region to address. Regional Development Programme provides investments that are devoted to education, health, social services, sustainable mobility, environment, access to public services, investment attractiveness, business environment etc. (27% of total EU structural funds).</p>
<p>The next step of the regional policy implementation was taken in January 2023, by approving the Description of the Procedure for Preparation and Implementation Monitoring of Sustainable Urban Development Strategies and Functional Zones’ Strategies. Regional centres (cities) are preparing Sustainable Urban Development Strategies to address social, economic, environmental and climate change challenges. Functional zones are created, and their strategies are prepared jointly by municipalities in order to increase the efficiency of the infrastructure and/or service network within the functional zones, to ensure all residents the access to this infrastructure and services, to create opportunities for joint actions of several municipalities covered by functional zone, and to implement joint investment projects.</p>
