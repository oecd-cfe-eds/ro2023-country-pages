<td><p>Proposal prepared by Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development envisage provision of EU funding of 2021-2027 planning period amounting to 1 021 909 159 Euros to measures to be implemented according to place-based approach. Amount of funding can be altered in the coordination process with sectoral ministries.</p>
<p>FISCAL EQUALISATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS</p>
<p>In 2023, local governments are provided with an increase in equalized revenues by 15.2% on average. The total amount of the local government financial equalization fund, comparing to 2022, has increased by 15.6% or 33.2 million euros. No municipality has a reduction in equalized revenues comparing to previous year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The purpose of the local government equalization is, taking into consideration the socioeconomic differences between local governments, to create similar possibilities for local governments to perform their functions laid down in law, as well as to promote their initiative and independence in the creation of their financial resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue of the equalisation fund shall consist of the local government payments specified as a result of calculation of the equalisation of local government finances and of the State budget grant.</p></li>
<li><p>The assessed revenue of each local government and the criteria characterising local government expenditure shall be used for calculating the equalisation of local government finances.</p></li>
<li><p>The assessed revenue of a local government consist of the revenue from the immovable property tax forecasted by local government, and the share of the allocation of the revenue from the personal income tax determined for the budgets of local governments in the Annual State Budget Law.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of equalising units are used for calculating the equalisation of local government finances which includes information regarding local government expenditure related to the criteria characterising local government expenditure. The calculated number of equalising units for each local government include demographic and territorial differences of the particular local government.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculation of the equalisation of local government finances shall be performed, taking into account the following principles:</p></li>
<li><p>a local government whose assessed revenue per one equalising unit is smaller than the average assessed revenue per one equalising unit in local governments in total receives a grant from the equalisation fund which is 60 percent of the difference between the average assessed revenues and the assessed revenues in a particular municipality per one equalising unit .</p></li>
<li><p>local government whose assessed revenue per one equalising unit is larger than the average assessed revenue per one equalising unit in local governments in total makes a payment into the equalisation fund which is 60 percent of the difference between the average assessed revenues and the assessed revenues in a particular municipality per one equalising unit .</p></li>
<li><p>the difference between the assessed revenue of a local government per one equalising unit and the assessed revenue of the local government per one equalising unit which has the largest revenue shall be reduced proportionally by means of the State budget grant.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result of the equalisation of local government finances the equalised revenue of a local government shall consist of the assessed revenue of the local government reduced by the calculated payment into the equalisation fund or increased by the calculated grant from the equalisation fund.</p></li>
