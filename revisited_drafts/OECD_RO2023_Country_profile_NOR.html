<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>Regional policy was a high-profile issue in the 2021-elections and the formation of the new government. The Government presented the White Paper – Meld. St. 27 (2022-23) ‘A good life throughout Norway - district policy for the future in June 2023.</p>
<p>The white paper on regional and rural (‘<em>distrikt’)</em> policy have the following themes and issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>goal on population growth in rural areas.</p></li>
<li><p>focus on small villages with the introduction of a pilot scheme for rural growth agreements.</p></li>
<li><p>evaluation and testing of measures (e.g., free kindergarten) to reverse population decline and stimulate population growth particularly in Finnmark and North Troms in the high north.</p></li>
<li><p>invest in broadband throughout the country and the possibility of decentralized work.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased access to higher education in rural areas.</p></li>
<li><p>The green shift provides new opportunities for industrial development and jobs in the rural areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower fares on ferries and air travels in rural areas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A regional and municipal reform was enforced in 2020, with a number of mergers both at the local and regional level. A change in government in 2021 resulted in reversal of some of the mergers, especially at the regional level (from 11 to 15 counties), with effect from 1.1.2024.</p>
<p>Among the aims of the regional reform implemented in 2020 was the enhancement of the role of counties in strategic development.</p>
<p><em><strong>Other budget increases</strong></em></p>
<p>Increased access to housing in the districts by prioritizing loans through the Norwegian State Housing Bank to the least central municipalities for loans for rental housing and loans for housing quality.</p>
<p>Increased subsidies for agriculture as an important rural industry.</p>
<p>Increases in the investment of broadband in rural areas. Collaboration with The Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS) on digitalisation policy and a common digitalisation strategy between KS and the government.</p>
<p>A new map for assisted areas in Norway (regional aid map) and Regionally Differentiated Social Security Concession (RDSSC) 2022-2027.</p>
<p>Changes in the policy guidelines on location of public sector jobs and public services (state), actively consider localization of state jobs to sparsely populated municipalities, including localization in northern Norway, and new and relocated state enterprises must now, as a general rule, be located outside the capital and other major cities.</p>
