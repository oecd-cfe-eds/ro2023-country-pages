<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p><em>Spatial Planning Act (SPA):</em> This bill is currently under development. Once implemented, it will ensure better and more strategic planning for how a region will grow, adapt and change over time, and how land, infrastructure and other resources will be used to promote the wellbeing of people, the environment and the economy. It will introduce, for the first time, a consistent, formal framework for spatial planning in New Zealand. It will provide certainty and enable change and adaptation in regions, with positive outcomes for the environment, community wellbeing and resilience. The SPA’s core function will be to mandate the use of spatial planning, which would require central government, local government and Māori to work together to develop long-term regional spatial strategies that set regional directions for at least the next 30 years. Work is underway to implement the SPA this year. The roll out will initially focus on three regions.</p>
<p><em>Natural and Built Environment Act (NBA):</em> This bill is currently under development. It will be the main replacement for the Resource Management Act 1991. It aims to protect and restore the environment while better enabling development. The NBA will require any use of the environment to comply with environmental limits and targets. The environmental limits will be set at the current state of the natural environment at the time the NBA is passed to avoid further degradation. Associated targets will also be required to drive improvement in the natural environment. In areas that are already unacceptably degraded, minimum level targets will be required to improve the state of the environment, ensuring that existing degradation is not locked in.</p>
<p><em>Climate Adaptation Act (CAA):</em> This bill is currently under development. It aims to address complex issues associated with managed retreat alongside funding climate adaptation. This is currently being worked on and is likely to be considered by the Government in 2023.</p>
<p><em>The Future for Local Government Review:</em> The review identifies how New Zealand’s systems of local democracy and governance need to evolve over the next 30 years, in order to improve the wellbeing of New Zealand communities and the environment while actively embodying the Treaty partnership. This review is tasked with looking at what local government will do in the future, how it will be done and how it will be funded. The aim is to complete the review in June 2023.</p>
<p><em>Industry Transformation Plans</em>: The New Zealand Government has committed to an industry policy which seeks to grow and transform sectors of the economy with significant potential, which would contribute to a highly productive, high-wage and low emissions economy. Industry Transformation Plans are created in partnership by business, workers, Māori and government, setting a long-term vision for transformative change and identifying near-term actions that will shift the sector toward realising it. These plans are currently under development. The eight industry transformation plans are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Advanced Manufacturing,</p></li>
<li><p>Agritech,</p></li>
<li><p>Construction,</p></li>
<li><p>Digital Technologies,</p></li>
<li><p>Fisheries,</p></li>
<li><p>Food and Beverage,</p></li>
<li><p>Forestry and Wood Processing, and</p></li>
<li><p>Tourism</p></li>
