<td>Objectives of regional policy</td>
<td><p>In line with the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 the main objective of the regional policy in Poland is: the effective use of endogenous potentials of territories and their specialisation to achieve sustainable development of the country which will create conditions for the growth of income of Polish residents while achieving coherence in the social, economic, environmental and spatial dimensions. Three specific objectives were also defined.</p>
<p>• Objective 1 Increasing the cohesion of country’s social, economic, environmental and spatial development.</p>
<p>• Objective 2 Strengthening regional competitive advantages.</p>
<p>• Objective 3 Improving quality of management and implementation of territorially targeted policies.</p>
<p>The main objective of the regional policy until 2030 will be implemented based on three specific objectives that complement one another. The role of the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 is to connect and coordinate horizontal measures taken to implement objectives, which include strengthening the competitiveness of all regions, cities and rural areas (objectives 2 and 3) with objective 1 which ensures greater cohesion in the country’s development through providing support to areas that are economically weaker.</p>
<p>The regional policy until 2030 focuses actions on levelling up the living standard and development opportunities of medium-sized cities that struggle to cope with the effects of losing their industrial and administrative functions, and usually in rural areas – at risk of permanent marginalisation. It provides them with support that requires taking comprehensive measures tailored to the local character of actions. By supporting competitiveness of the regions, the policy assumes continued measures aimed at raising the quality of human and social capital and developing entrepreneurship and innovation. The strategy attaches great importance to developing competencies within public administration that are necessary for pursuing an effective development policy, in particular in territories with low development potential.</p>
<p>Horizontal matters addressed by the objectives:</p>
<p>• improving competitiveness of the regions based on making optimal use of their potential for development, having a proactive innovation policy, developing human and social capital in order to adjust their quality to the needs of the labour market and addressing infrastructural shortcomings,</p>
<p>• improving access to public services, building a culture of solidarity, shared responsibility and cooperation,</p>
<p>• improving the administrative potential and functioning of institutions, as well as their cooperation and active involvement in development activities.</p></td>

<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The Polish Government is embarking on a wide-ranging reappraisal of the institutional and policy context for regional development. Directions for the policy were set out in the Strategy for Responsible Development (SOR), launched in 2017 and the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 (NSRD), launched in 2019. These included the objective of increased cohesion, with a mix of both regional and local integrated strategies, and place-based project intervention. Of particular note is an increased focus on ‘areas of strategic intervention’, increasing the emphasis on small and medium sized towns, medium sized cities losing their socio-economic functions and peripheral, rural or declining areas, alongside the main urban centres (areas at risk of permanent marginalisation). The persistence of territorial disparities in socio-economic, environmental and institutional conditions, particularly at sub-regional levels and the territorially differentiated impact of the pandemic has underlined the importance of these new policy directions. Over the past year, a range of measures have been undertaken to build on these initiatives with the overall aim of strengthening the territorial dimension in development policy. This is seen as central to successfully implementing Poland’s National Strategy for Regional Development, and to efficient use of EU Cohesion Policy. The regional strategies have been updated based on National Strategy for Regional Development. At the moment the work is underway on a new long-term vision document National Development Concept 2050. This will not act as a strategy with priorities and goals but rather sets out scenarios of development which will be used to update medium term strategy – the Strategy for Responsible Development and also the National Regional Development Strategy and sectoral strategies. The Concept is based on the identification of key issues (e.g., demographic change, climate change etc.) and it will develop scenarios around these with cross-cutting social, economic and territorial dimensions.</p>
<p>At supra-local level, a functional approach and cooperation of local governments is promoted, supra-local development strategies and strategies for EU territorial instruments are created.</p>
<p>In the Strategy for Responsible Development and the National Strategy for Regional Development the project approach is implemented as a way of implementation. As a result, various projects are being implemented to support development and local authorities, e.g. Local Development, the Advisory Support Centre, the Cities' Partnership Initiative. The Advisory Support Centre (ASD) is a NSRD strategic project with the main goal of strengthening the administrative efficiency of these local governments (municipalities and counties), including improving their competences in strategic management and initiating and implementing comprehensive development projects in partnership with neighbouring local governments. ASD pilot was launched in September 2020. The aim of this project is to support local government administration, especially this which are at risk of permanent marginalisation, in preparing development projects, multifaceted and integrated, which play a major role in improving the socio-economic situation in a functional area. The activities within the project contribute to improve administrative efficiency in local governments, and, as a result – better implementation of public policies. Continuation of ASD project is ASD Plus. The aim of the ASD Plus project is to strengthen the competences of municipalities and counties to manage strategic local development in socio-economic partnerships.</p>
<p>In the field of urban policy framework in Poland – the new guidelines for cities and central administration were adopted - National Urban Policy 2030 (NUP 2030). Since 2015, when the first Polish NUP was adopted, main urban challenges such as climate crisis, urban sprawl or house deficit have not disappeared but even intensified. In addition, urban areas must face new difficulties – pandemic, refugee crisis and economic instability. Having in mind the dynamically changing world and arising challenges Poland puts more emphasis on above topics and underlines the need for cities to be flexible, resilient and transformative. The National Urban Policy 2030 defines six goals that are part of the vision for long-term urban development. These goals are defined as: compact, green, productive, smart, accessible and efficient city. Moreover, NUP focuses on balancing territorial inequalities. An integrated territorial approach adopted in this document aims to affect both cities and their functional areas in order to bring improvement in the entire area, provide cohesion and ensures rational spending of money and minimization of social and environmental costs. An important part of NUP 2030 is the implementation plan. The document introduces a dedicated Executive Council for implementation of NUP composed of sectoral ministries and cities associations. The coordination and cooperation of different actors at national and regional level is the key to successful implementation of NUP 2030 goals.</p>
<p>National Urban Policy 2030 consists of several instruments, legal, organizational and financial solutions that help to implement goals set in the document. Within organisation of 11th World Urban Forum in Katowice, Poland developed one of the strategic projects of NUP 2030 - Action Plan for Cities initiative - under which over 100 cities received individual advisory support in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the local level. As part of the project was created "Action Plan for Cities" - a catalogue of projects implemented by the cities participating in the project; The "Handbook" - a collection of good practices in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in cities and the "Toolbox for Local Communities", which is an online encyclopaedia for residents containing a knowledge base on how they can influence urban space and city management processes.</p>
<p>One of the strategic projects of the National Urban Policy 2030 is the Cities' Partnership Initiative (CPI). The CPI is a programme for the exchange and promotion of knowledge between cities and other actors involved in the formulation and implementation of urban policy also from national level. It is a response to the need voiced by local governments to exchange knowledge and experience between cities and other entities involved in shaping and implementing urban policy, as well as to obtain ideas on how to strengthen the development potential of Polish cities. The main objective of the initiative is to improve development conditions and to support integrated and sustainable development of Polish cities, including solutions useful for improving management efficiency. In the pilot edition of the project, 34 cities participated in the work of the three thematic networks on urban mobility, regeneration, and air quality between 2017 and 2019. In 2021, a new edition of the project was launched with 30 cities participating. This time, work is being carried out within the following thematic networks: Digital City, Green City, City of PPP initiatives. Further editions of the project are planned.</p>
