<h2 id="recent-policy-developments">Recent policy developments</h2>
<p>The main components of the policy mix – institutional framework and cohesion policy priorities and investments – are established in order to promote a balanced territorial development between different regions, between rural and urban areas, between coastal and the hinterland zones, in order to reduce long-lasting asymmetries and inequalities in Portugal that persist. The goal of promote growth in all regions is reflected in the vision defined in Strategy Portugal 2030 “Recover the economy and protect jobs, and make the next decade a recovery and convergence of Portugal with the European Union, ensuring greater resilience and social and territorial cohesion.” Promoting territorial cohesion will be mandatory to counteract territorial inequalities, as established in the integrated strategy for the valorisation of inland territories (RCM nº 18/2020), based on attracting/fixing population, promoting private investment to create jobs, stimulating the knowledge and innovation transfer from the academy to the socioeconomic tissue, and guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest.</p>
<h3 id="institutional-changes">Institutional changes</h3>
<p>The current main developments related to the regional institutional framework, in Portugal, are the reforms on the administrative decentralization to the municipalites (as well to the intermunicipal cooperation and parishes) and administrative deconcentration to the CCDR (Regional Development and Coordination Commissions).</p>
<p>Portugal is expanding its subnational policy footprint through decentralization. The Law n. º 50/2018, of 16th of August, and related legislation have provided municipalities (in <em>lato sensu,</em> including metropolitan areas, intermunicipal communities and parishes, as well) with new competences, responsibilities and resources granting more proximity to its citizens and efficiency to the public policy. Traditionally, Portugal has highly centralized governmental structure with a lower proportion of public spending in the subnational levels, than the EU and OECD averages. This process might change the <em>status quo</em>, reinforcing local-based policies and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Recently, the Portuguese government approved the administrative deconcentrating reform to the CCDRs, which will acquire the status of special public institutes, with the objective of carrying out deconcentrated competences of the central administration and provide better public services to citizens, working as one-stop-shop in a regional level, and provider of services of general interest (e.g., health, education, culture, agriculture, and others) in its territory. In a country without regional level, in the mainland, this process is considered a steppingstone to a future debate about regionalisation process. Along with this, a process of revision for NUTS II was developed to make them coherent with the area covered by CCDR.</p>
<h3 id="eu-structural-funds">EU Structural Funds</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://portugal2030.pt/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/sfc2021-PA-2021PT16FFPA001-2.0_vf.pdf">Cohesion Policy Partnership Agreement</a> (Portugal 2030) between the EU Commission and Portugal, adopted in July 2022, sets out investment priorities for the period 2021-2027 with a total of €23 billion to support the economic, social and territorial cohesion until the end of the decade. The <a href="https://portugal2030.pt/programas/">7 regional programmes</a> will have a total of €9,7 billion and are particularly focused on territorial policies and investments, which are reinforced by the ongoing decentralization process in the mainland and contributes to the European strategic objectives: a Europe closer to citizens, a greener Europe and a more competitive Europe. The new Just Transition Fund will support three subregions impacted by the closure of two coal-fired power plant (in Médio Tejo and Alentejo Litoral) and one refinery (in Matosinhos, Metropolitan Area of Porto).</p>
<p>As concerns the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), one of its key objectives is to promote social and territorial cohesion. Portugal’s <a href="https://recuperarportugal.gov.pt/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PRR.pdf">National Recovery and Resilience Plan</a> (NRRP) accounts to almost €17 billion, with more than €11 billion allocated to the “resilience dimension”, more than €3 billion destined to the “climate transition” and almost €2,5 billion to the “digital transition”. In general, the use of the RRF versus Cohesion Policy funds is guided by eligibility, competences, timing and investment scale. The national government has focussed its investment on human resources within administrations, strengthening the capacities for effective management of public investment particularly at territorial level.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.portugal.gov.pt/download-ficheiros/ficheiro.aspx?v=%3d%3dBQAAAB%2bLCAAAAAAABAAzNDCzNAcAHS%2bXPAUAAAA%3d">National Investment Programme 2030</a> (PNI 2030) aims to be the planning tool for the next cycle of strategic and structural investments at national level, to meet the needs and challenges of the next decade and decades to come. The scope of the PNI 2030 is multisectoral, focusing on the mobility and transport sectors, key factors for the country’s external competitiveness and internal cohesion, the environment, energy and irrigation, fundamental to face the challenges of decarbonization and energy transition.</p>
