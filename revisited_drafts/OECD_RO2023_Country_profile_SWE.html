<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The National strategy for sustainable regional development throughout Sweden 2021–2030 is the framework for the regional development policy until 2030. The national strategy was submitted by the previous government in March 2021 in the form of a letter (<em>skr. 2020/21:133</em>) to the Parliament (Riksdag). The Riksdag approved it in June 2022 in accordance with the proposal of the Committee on Industry and Trade. The strategy highlights three basic prerequisites for effective implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>capacity for regional and local development work</p></li>
<li><p>regional consideration and cooperation between state agencies, regions and other actors, as well as</p></li>
<li><p>learning through analysis, follow-up, evaluation and research.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the strategy, there are four strategic areas that will form the basis for the implementation of the regional development policy 2021–2030. The strategy with its strategic areas and priorities is indicative for the regional development strategies of the regions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>equal opportunities for housing, work and welfare throughout the country</p></li>
<li><p>competence supply and competence development throughout the country</p></li>
<li><p>innovation and renewal as well as entrepreneurship and business development throughout the country</p></li>
<li><p>accessibility throughout the country through digital communication and the transport system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The commission approved the Swedish partnership agreement in May 2022. The Partnership Agreement sets out the strategic orientation for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Just Transition Fund (JTF), the European Social Fund+ (ESF+) and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF).</p>
<p>All ERDF-programs, including all Interreg programs in which Sweden participates, were approved in 2022. The national program and the eight regional programmes comprise a total of approximately EUR 2,1 billion, including Swedish co-financing during the program period. In addition, the national envelope from ERDF regarding cross-border and transnational cooperation is EUR 358 million. The implementation of the ERDF-programs means that important investments in entrepreneurship, innovations, energy efficiency, climate change, circular economy and cross-regional cooperation can be made around the country.</p>
