<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>National Strategy of Regional Development (NSRD) functions as a blueprint for the regional development plans of 26 regional development agencies (DAs), action plans of regional administrations, other national and regional development strategies, the public investment and budgeting process, and specific territorial development programs.</p>
<p>The new NSRD (2024-2028) is in the preparation phase and its vision is “A globally competitive and fully developed Türkiye by using its local dynamics and prosperous regions.” The elaboration process of the new NSRD involves input, consultation, and negotiation with various stakeholders, including the public and private sectors, NGOs, universities, development agencies (DAs), and local entities. NSRD is intended to serve as the primary coordination document for regional development policies and to be the second comprehensive plan focused on addressing regional development disparities and enhancing regional competitiveness in Türkiye.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the new NSRD, eight themes have been determined;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Urban Development,</p></li>
<li><p>Rural Development,</p></li>
<li><p>Social Policies,</p></li>
<li><p>Industry-Logistics-Transportation,</p></li>
<li><p>Green Growth,</p></li>
<li><p>R&amp;D,</p></li>
<li><p>Innovation and Entrepreneurship,</p></li>
<li><p>Digitalization and</p></li>
<li><p>Tourism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies have been developed for the 2024-2028 period under these themes. After undergoing technical evaluations, the strategy will be approved by the Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye.</p>
