<p>Recent policy developments</p>
<p>The United States has always had a focus on policies that address place-based needs. Most recently, there has been a greater emphasis on equity, especially for historically underserved geographies and populations. This includes rural areas, tribal lands, and minorities such as Black, Latino, and American Indian populations. The U.S. is taking a whole of government approach to address regional inequalities. In terms of new initiatives, a key example is EDA’s recent $3 billion American Rescue Plan program to meet the urgent needs of American communities for economic recovery and resiliency in face of the pandemic. In 2022, EDA made 780 grants awarded through six innovative programs to support transformational American Rescue Plan projects.</p>
<p>EDA’s American Rescue Plan grant programs include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/arpa/build-back-better">Build Back Better Regional Challenge</a>: $1 billion awarded to 21 regional coalitions (5-8 component awards per coalition), each of which received between $25 million and $65 million to transform their regional economy by growing an industry sector. EDA also gave awards to 60 phase 1 finalists to support the development of their ambitious projects.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/arpa/good-job-challenge">Good Jobs Challenge</a>: $500 million awarded to 32 industry-led workforce training partnerships to invest in innovative approaches to workforce development that will secure job opportunities for more than 50,000 Americans.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/arpa/economic-adjustment-assistance">Economic Adjustment Assistance program</a>: $500 million awarded to 256 diverse projects —including but not limited to enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities and planning grants — to address the economic development needs of communities today while preparing them for the future by in investing in enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities, and planning grants.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/arpa/indigenous">Indigenous Communities program</a>: $100 million awarded to 51 grantees to support economic development projects in Indigenous communities for similar types of projects as described under Economic Adjustment Assistance. Across all six American Rescue Plan programs, inclusive of the Indigenous Communities program, EDA awarded a total of 127 grants totalling $448 million.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/travel-tourism">Travel, Tourism &amp; Outdoor Recreation program</a>: $750 million awarded to 185 grantees to help support regions hard hit by declines to these industries through projects to build new tourist attractions (museums, event venues, hiking trails, campgrounds, etc.), develop tourism-related economic plans, and support workforce training in the tourism sector.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.eda.gov/arpa/research">Statewide Planning, Research &amp; Networks</a>: $1 million planning grants to each of the 59 U.S. states and territories and $31 million to 14 research and networks (also known as Communities of Practice) grantees.</p></li>
